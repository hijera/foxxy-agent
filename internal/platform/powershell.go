// PowerShell receives the command as a script rather than as a shell word, so
// nothing here escapes, quotes, or strips the caller's text: it is embedded
// verbatim between a prologue and an epilogue.
//
// The prologue switches the output encoding to UTF-8. Without it PowerShell and
// the native tools it spawns write in the console output code page (866 on a
// Russian Windows install), which reaches us as mojibake and makes error
// messages unreadable to the model. Assigning [Console]::OutputEncoding fails
// when the process has no console attached, so it is guarded; $OutputEncoding is
// set unconditionally because it governs what PowerShell pipes to child
// processes.

// The epilogue restores exit-code fidelity. powershell.exe -Command collapses
// every failure to 1, so `cmd /c exit 3` would be reported as exit status 1.
// $? is captured first because the following `if` overwrites it.

// wrapPowerShellCommand returns command as a PowerShell script with the
