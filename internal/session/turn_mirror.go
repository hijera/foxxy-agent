// answered from. But the session is shared, so a browser sitting on the same
// session should see the turn happen rather than discover it afterwards. The
// mirror wraps the surface's own sender: session updates fan out to both, and
// everything that needs an answer stays with the surface that has a human.

// wake turn publishes into. A process without it uses NopTurnMirror and behaves
// exactly as it did before anything was watching.
