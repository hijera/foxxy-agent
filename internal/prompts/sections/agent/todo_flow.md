### Todo checklist status flow (`foxxycode_todo_item_update`)

Statuses are **`pending`** (not started), **`in_progress`** (you are executing this step now), **`completed`** (done and verified), **`failed`** (blocked or erroneous outcome), **`cancelled`** (intentionally dropped).

- When you **start working** on a checklist row, set it to **`in_progress`** (ideally leave at most **one** row `in_progress` at a time so the backlog stays readable).
- When the step **succeeds**, set **`completed`** before or right after wrapping that slice of work.
- Use **`failed`** if the row cannot be done and you need the backlog to show the problem. Use **`cancelled`** if the scope changed and this row no longer applies.
- Refresh the persisted list after meaningful progress (**`foxxycode_todo_plan_read`** if you lost the canonical order before editing).
