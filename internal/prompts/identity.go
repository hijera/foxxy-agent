// Identity is the self-identification sentence every FoxxyCode-authored system
// prompt opens with.
//
// Why it exists: an LLM gateway cannot tell one OpenAI-compatible client from
// another by the wire protocol, so gateways classify traffic by matching the
// opening of the system prompt against a table of known products
// ("You are Claude Code…", "You are Cline…"). FoxxyCode used to open with a
// generic sentence and was therefore invisible in that kind of analytics.
//
// Treat this string as a published contract: gateways key on it, and changing
// the wording silently drops FoxxyCode out of their reports until they catch up.
const Identity = "You are FoxxyCode, an AI coding agent."

// IdentityMarker is the lowercase substring a gateway keys on. It is kept
// separate from Identity so the surrounding sentence can be reworded without
// breaking attribution.
const IdentityMarker = "you are foxxycode"

// identityWindow mirrors how much of a system prompt a gateway inspects
// (NeuralDeep reads the first 220 characters, lowercases them, then matches
// substrings). A marker outside that prefix is as good as absent, so the
// dedup check below uses the same window rather than scanning the whole text.
const identityWindow = 220

// WithIdentity guarantees a system prompt names FoxxyCode inside the window a
// gateway looks at.
//
// A prompt that already identifies itself there — the built-in templates do —
// is returned untouched, so the common path reads as one natural sentence
// instead of a stacked identity line plus a generic opener. Everything else
// (a user's own prompts.dir template, the render fallback, the auxiliary
// summarizer/title/memory prompts) gets the line prepended.
