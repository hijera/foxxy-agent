// readQueuedMessages folds the follow-ups written during this turn into the
// conversation and reports whether there were any.
//
// A queued message becomes an ordinary user message: appended to the slice the
// next request is built from, added to the transcript (so the answer that
// follows has a visible cause, and a compaction rebuild keeps it), and sent to
// the clients watching as the message itself, so it appears in the conversation
// where it was read.
//
// The shorter queue is not announced from here. The drain is a change like any
// other, and the session announces it through the notifier the manager
// installed, so every client of a shared session hears about it with the same
// payload and the same version - not only whoever is reading this turn.
