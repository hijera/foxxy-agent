// The turn context block: everything the model needs that moves while a turn
// runs, carried after the replayed history instead of inside the system prompt.
//
// A provider caches a request by its prefix. The system message is messages[0],
// so a byte that moves there throws away the cached copy of the whole
// conversation behind it - the wall clock alone did that on every single
// request. Keeping the system message frozen for the turn and appending what
// moved turns the cache miss into the last few hundred tokens of the request.
