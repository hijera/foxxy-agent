// The transcript row a compaction draws while it runs.
//
// Compaction used to be invisible until it was over: the turn stopped, one
// summarization call went out, and the only thing a client saw was the summary
// row appearing afterwards. That was tolerable while it was one call. It is not
// once the fold takes several passes over a history that outgrew the window -
// the session sits silent for a minute with nothing to say why - and it is not
// once the model itself may ask for a compaction, because then the work has to
// be attributable in the transcript like any other tool call.
//
// So every compaction draws the same row a tool call draws: announced when it
// starts, updated with the pass it is on, closed with what it folded. A
// compaction the model asked for reuses the row the loop already announced for
// its compact_context call, so the work appears once, under the call that
// ordered it - and that one is an ordinary tool call, so it is in the
// transcript afterwards like any other.
//
// The row a compaction draws for itself is live only. It reports work in
// progress to whoever is watching, and the durable record of what happened is
// the compaction summary row the fold inserts into the transcript; writing a
// tool-call row no message refers to would leave an orphan in the bundle.
