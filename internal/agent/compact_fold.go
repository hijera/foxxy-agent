// Multi-step compaction: folding a history that no longer fits one
// summarization request.
//
// A single call was enough while the transcript stayed near the window it was
// measured against. It stops being enough exactly when compaction matters
// most: a session that ran far past its window - a model that kept reading
// large files, an automatic trigger that never fired because the window was
// unknown - arrives at /compact with a history several times the summarizer's
// window, and the one request the old path built was refused by the provider
// ("the request is too long, shorten the message history"). The session was
// then stuck: too big to send, and the only thing that could shrink it was the
// call that would not go out.
//
// So the head is folded in passes. Each pass carries the summary of everything
// folded so far plus the next run of transcript, both sized to the summarizer's
// own context window, and answers with one summary that covers both. The last
// pass's answer is the summary that goes into the transcript, so a compaction
// that took seven calls is indistinguishable in the session from one that took
// one.
