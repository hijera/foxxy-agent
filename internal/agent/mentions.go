package agent

// The agent's half of mentions. The manager resolves every "@" reference of
// a prompt into attachment resources (internal/session/mentions.go); here
// they are written into the user message, and the rules the mentioned paths
// activate - a glob rule, a nested AGENTS.md - ride in that same message as
// attachments of their own. A rule the model can read in its history is not
// repeated in the system prompt, so a mention never moves the system message
// and never costs the provider's cached copy of the conversation behind it.
