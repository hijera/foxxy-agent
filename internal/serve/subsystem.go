// Package serve owns what `foxxycode serve` is: one process that runs every
// subsystem the configuration enables, over one session manager.
//
// A surface used to be a subcommand and therefore a process of its own, which
// meant the messenger gateway and the HTTP API could only look at the same
// sessions through the filesystem and never at the same time. Here they are
// goroutines under one supervisor instead: a Telegram conversation is a live
// session in the web UI, a swarm node can serve its own API while relaying for
// others, and turning a surface on is a line of YAML rather than a second unit
// file.
//
// This package knows nothing about the surfaces themselves. Each one is
// described by a Subsystem the CLI hands over, so a binary built without the
// build tag that carries a surface still compiles, still parses its
// configuration, and still says exactly which tag is missing.
