// terminal and adds a provider with its models; an operator edits the file in
// vim; a deployment drops a new one in. Without this, a daemon keeps serving the
// document it read at boot, and the model list in every open browser is the one
// from before the login.

// are atomic renames, which an inotify watch on the file itself stops seeing
// after the first one; watching the directory instead means a dependency and a
// second set of platform behaviours for a file that changes a few times a day.
