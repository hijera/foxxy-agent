// searchDescription is what the model reads before it decides to search. The
// text it replaced ended with an instruction never to call the tool more than
// twice for one information need, which taught the model to abandon a subject
// after two attempts at a tool that was failing on every one of them.
const searchDescription = `Search the public web across several engines at once and return merged results: title, URL and a short snippet each.

The answer carries an "engines" block reporting what every backend did: "ok" with a count, "empty" when it answered a result page with nothing on it, or "blocked" with a reason when it answered a challenge, an unreadable layout, or a set of results unrelated to the query. Read it before concluding anything:
- results present: use them, and call webfetch on the ones worth reading in full - a snippet is not an answer;
- zero results with every engine "ok" or "empty": the web really has nothing under those words. Search again with different words - broader, or the terms the sources themselves would use - rather than repeating the query;
- engines "blocked": search from this machine is degraded, not the subject. Say so instead of concluding the subject does not exist.

Use "page" to go further down the same result list, "site" to restrict to one domain, "max_results" to ask for fewer or more rows.`
