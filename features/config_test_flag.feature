Feature: Checking config.yaml before anything starts
  An operator edits ~/.foxxycode/config.yaml by hand and learns about a typo only when a
  surface misbehaves, because the loader decodes the file leniently: a key it does not
  know is ignored, and a value of the wrong shape surfaces as a runtime error somewhere
  else. The -t / --test-config flag of the console, of foxxycode acp, of foxxycode http and of
  foxxycode serve checks the file the process would load against the published JSON Schema and the loader's own
  rules, then prints every problem with its line, what is wrong and how to fix it. It starts
  nothing and touches nothing: the backup recovery a normal load performs never runs.
  A problem is placed where it is - the parser blames the line its enclosing block began
  on, which on a commented file is a blank line far above - and a file an editor on Windows
  wrote reads exactly like one written anywhere else. A switch is spelled `enable`, the way
  upstream coddy spells it; a file written before that rename says `enabled`, and is read the
  same way the loader reads it: the switch counts, and the report only warns about the spelling.

  Scenario: a valid config passes and nothing is started or created
    Given a config.yaml with one provider and one model
    When I run foxxycode serve with --test-config
    Then the command succeeds
    And the report says the config is valid
    And nothing was created under the home besides config.yaml

  @http
  Scenario: foxxycode http, the command the editor plugins start, checks the same way
    Given a config.yaml whose logger.level is "verbose"
    When I run foxxycode http with -t
    Then the command fails
    And the report points at the line of "verbose"
    And nothing was created under the home besides config.yaml

  Scenario: a misspelled key is reported with its line and the key that was meant
    Given a config.yaml whose httpserver section says "enbaled: true" on line 3
    When I run foxxycode with -t
    Then the command fails
    And the report points at line 3 of the config file
    And the report names the unknown key "enbaled" and suggests "enable"

  Scenario: a config written before the switch rename passes, with a warning about its key
    Given a config.yaml whose httpserver section says "enabled: false" on line 3
    When I run foxxycode serve with --test-config
    Then the command succeeds
    And the report says the config is valid
    And the report warns at line 3 that "enabled" is read as "enable"

  Scenario: a value outside the allowed set comes with the values that are allowed
    Given a config.yaml whose logger.level is "verbose"
    When I run foxxycode serve with --test-config
    Then the command fails
    And the report points at the line of "verbose"
    And the report lists the allowed values "debug, info, warn, warning, error"

  Scenario: a broken line is reported where it is, not where its section began
    Given a config.yaml whose provider entry loses one space of indentation on line 22
    When I run foxxycode with -t
    Then the command fails
    And the report points at line 22 of the config file

  Scenario: a config saved by a Windows editor reads like any other
    Given a config.yaml with one provider and one model saved as Windows text
    When I run foxxycode serve with --test-config
    Then the command succeeds
    And the report says the config is valid
    And the report has nothing else to say

  Scenario: an output cap the provider never sends is reported as bounding nothing
    Given a config.yaml whose codex model sets max_tokens on line 7
    When I run foxxycode with -t
    Then the command succeeds
    And the report points at line 7 of the config file
    And the report warns that max_tokens bounds nothing on a codex model

  Scenario: the check never rewrites the file
    Given a config.yaml with a broken value and a valid config.yaml.bak beside it
    When I run foxxycode acp with -t
    Then the command fails
    And config.yaml still has the broken value
