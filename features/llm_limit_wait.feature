Feature: FoxxyCode waits for a hit usage limit to lift when asked to
  Claude Desktop's "auto-continue when limits reset". A provider that names
  the moment its limit reopens (a Retry-After far beyond the retry budget)
  ends the turn with the error by default; with agent.wait_for_limit_reset
  the top-level turn waits under the turn context, keeps the countdown on
  every surface with a provider_usage update, and then re-issues the same
  call. The user message is persisted before the call, so nothing repeats.

  Scenario: With the option on, the turn waits for the reset and then answers
    Given an agent whose provider first reports a limit that lifts in 1 s and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn ends with "done" after 2 provider calls
    And the turn took at least 1 s
    And the client saw a resuming usage update with the reset time

  Scenario: Off by default, the turn ends with the provider error
    Given an agent whose provider first reports a limit that lifts in 1 s and then answers "done"
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn fails with the quota reset error after 1 provider call
    And the client saw no resuming usage update

  Scenario: A pause beyond the configured maximum ends the turn at once
    Given an agent whose provider first reports a limit that lifts in 1 s and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on with a maximum of 300 ms
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn fails with the quota reset error after 1 provider call
    And the turn never waited on the limit

  Scenario: The retry wrapper's own verdict drives the wait
    Given an agent whose provider answers a 429 naming a reset in 1 s through the retry wrapper and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn ends with "done" after 2 provider calls
    And the turn took at least 1 s
    And the client saw a resuming usage update with the reset time

  Scenario: A second limit in the same turn counts against the same maximum
    Given an agent whose provider reports a limit that lifts in 1 s twice and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on with a maximum of 1500 ms
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn fails with the quota reset error after 2 provider calls
    And the turn took at least 1 s

  Scenario: The maximum bounds the retry wrapper's own sleeps as well
    Given an agent whose provider answers a 429 naming a reset in 1 s through the retry wrapper and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on with a maximum of 300 ms
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn fails with the quota reset error after 1 provider call
    And the turn never waited on the limit

  Scenario: The retry wrapper's own sleeps count against the same maximum
    Given an agent whose provider answers a 429 naming a reset in 1 s twice through the retry wrapper and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on with a maximum of 1500 ms
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn fails with the quota reset error after 2 provider calls
    And the turn took at least 1 s
    And the turn waited less than 1500 ms on the limit

  Scenario: An explicit zero never sleeps on a limit, the retry wrapper included
    Given an agent whose provider answers a 429 naming a reset in 1 s through the retry wrapper and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on with a maximum of 0 ms
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn fails with the quota reset error after 1 provider call
    And the turn never waited on the limit

  Scenario: Stop during the wait ends the turn as cancelled
    Given an agent whose provider first reports a limit that lifts in 30 s and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on
    When the user sends a turn and stops it while it waits
    Then the turn ends as cancelled after 1 provider call
    And the turn waited less than 1000 ms on the limit

  Scenario: A retry sleep on a call that then succeeded counts against the same maximum
    Given an agent whose provider sleeps through a 429 naming a reset in 1 s, answers nothing, hits the limit again and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on with a maximum of 1500 ms
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn fails with the quota reset error after 3 provider calls
    And the turn took at least 1 s
    And the turn waited less than 1500 ms on the limit

  Scenario: A 429 that names no pause never starts a wait
    Given an agent whose provider keeps answering 429 without naming a pause and would then answer "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on
    When the user sends a turn
    Then the turn fails with the provider's error after 4 provider calls
    And the client saw no resuming usage update

  Scenario: A cancel that is not the user's Stop ends the turn with the limit and names the cause
    Given an agent whose provider first reports a limit that lifts in 30 s and then answers "done"
    And wait_for_limit_reset is on
    When the user sends a turn and the client goes away while it waits
    Then the turn fails with the quota reset error after 1 provider call
    And the error names the interrupted wait
    And the turn waited less than 1000 ms on the limit
