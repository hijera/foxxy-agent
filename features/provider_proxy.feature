Feature: Each provider reaches its server the way its own proxy setting says
  A provider row follows the proxy the environment of the FoxxyCode process names
  (HTTPS_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY, NO_PROXY) unless providers[].proxy says otherwise:
  "none" connects directly and ignores that proxy, and a proxy URL selects
  that proxy subject to the fork's NO_PROXY and loopback bypass. Leaving the key out, or writing
  "inherit", keeps the behaviour FoxxyCode always had. The setting covers every
  request the row makes - the completions, the model list, the account usage
  and the sign-in - and belongs to its row alone, so a provider that needs a
  proxy and one that must go direct live side by side in one config.

  Scenario Outline: Every request of a provider follows the provider's setting
    Given the environment names a proxy for every request
    And a "neuraldeep" provider "hub" <setting>
    When "hub" is asked for a completion, its model list, its account usage and a sign-in code
    Then every answer comes back
    And the environment's proxy carried <through the environment> requests
    And the own proxy of "hub" carried <through its own proxy> requests
    And the model server was reached directly <directly> times

    Examples:
      | setting                 | through the environment | through its own proxy | directly |
      | without a proxy setting | 4                       | 0                     | 0        |
      | with proxy "inherit"    | 4                       | 0                     | 0        |
      | with proxy "none"       | 0                       | 0                     | 4        |
      | with a proxy of its own | 0                       | 0                     | 4        |

  Scenario: A proxy URL on one provider leaves the direct provider next to it alone
    Given the environment names a proxy for every request
    And an "openai" provider "remote" with a proxy of its own
    And an "openai" provider "local" with proxy "none"
    When "remote" is asked for a completion
    And "local" is asked for a completion
    Then every answer comes back
    And the own proxy of "remote" carried 0 requests
    And the own proxy of "local" carried 0 requests
    And the environment's proxy carried 0 requests
    And the model server was reached directly 2 times
