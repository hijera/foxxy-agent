# Agent Notes for FoxxyCode

Short map for automation-friendly contributors.

## Repository navigation

| Area | Responsibility |
|------|------------------|
| `cmd/foxxycode` | CLI entry (`acp`, `http`, `sessions`, `skills`, `mcp`, `codex login`, `rules list`, `update`). |
| `internal/agent` | ReAct orchestration, MCP/tool wiring. |
| `internal/mcp` | MCP transports, merged server list, and the **workspace trust gate** for project-local **`.foxxycode/mcp.json`** (**`trust.go`**, **`gate.go`**; policy **`mcp.project_trust`**, approvals in **`<home>/mcp-trust.json`**). Guide: **`docs/mcp-integration.md`**. |
| `internal/textenc` | The one place a file's encoding is decided: prompt attachments and every file tool. Guide: **`docs/architecture.md`**. |
| `internal/bgtask` | Background task pool for detached shell commands (**`run_command`** **`background: true`** plus the **`background_*`** tools, the Tasks panel, and **`/foxxycode/sessions/{id}/background-tasks`**). **`Pool.Adopt`** takes over a foreground command that outlived its timeout instead of killing it. Guide: **`docs/background-tasks.md`**. |
| `internal/session` | Session manager, Filesystem persistence, Acp hooks, rules catalog. |
| `external/httpserver` | **`foxxycode http`** when built with **`tags=http`** (SSE bridge,Swagger statics,`/foxxycode` REST,ServeMux wiring). |
| `external/ui` | Embedded SPA (`go:embed`) when built with **`tags=http,ui`**. |
| `external/memory` | Long-term memory copilot (**`-tags memory`**; see README there). |
| `external/gateway` | Messenger gateway (**`-tags gateway.telegram`** or **`-tags gateway`**): Telegram bot adapter, session store, proxy support. Full guide: **`docs/gateway.md`**, rules: **`.cursor/rules/gateway.mdc`**. |

## Builds

Run **`make build TAGS=http`** for the HTTP gateway only (**`foxxycode http`** REST and **`/docs`**, no **npm**). Run **`make build TAGS="http ui"`** to link the embedded SPA (**Makefile** runs **ui-build** before **go build**). Recommended full image matches **`Dockerfile`** (**`make build TAGS="http ui scheduler memory"`**). Default **`make build`** omits HTTPServer, scheduler, and memory to keep dependency surface lean.

Primary conversational surface for bundled UI lives at **`POST /v1/responses`** with **`stream:true`**. Prefer it over **`POST /v1/chat/completions`** when shipping FoxxyCode-hosted experiences.

Swagger lives at **`/docs/`**, OpenAPI YAML at **`/openapi.yaml`**.

## Pre-commit gate

A git **`pre-commit`** hook runs the linter before every commit, so nothing lands with lint errors. It is the single enforcement point for humans and coding agents alike. The full test matrix (**`make test`**) is slow, so it is **opt-in** on commit and belongs in CI / before push.

- Enable once per clone: **`make hooks`** (sets **`core.hooksPath=.githooks`**; this is local config and is not committed, so every clone runs it once).
- On commit, **`.githooks/pre-commit`** calls **`scripts/checks.sh`**, which runs **`make lint`** by default. Commits touching only non-code files (docs, etc.) skip the gate.
- Scope knobs: **`FOXXYCODE_HOOK_TESTS=fast`** also runs a quick **`go test ./...`**, **`FOXXYCODE_HOOK_TESTS=full`** the whole matrix; **`FOXXYCODE_HOOK_LINT=0`** skips the linter; **`FOXXYCODE_HOOK_SKIP=1`** bypasses everything.
- Emergency bypass for a single commit: **`git commit --no-verify`**.
- Both gates compile the **host** platform only. Changing a file behind **`//go:build windows`**, or a signature it shares with the rest of the tree, needs **`make check-windows`** (cross-build plus **`go vet`** over every non-**`ui`** tag combination, test files included) and **`make lint-windows`**. CI runs both, and additionally runs **`go test`** on a real **`windows-latest`** runner for **`internal/platform`**, **`internal/bgtask`**, and **`internal/tools/shell`**.
- On Windows the hook runs under the bash that ships with Git for Windows; no extra setup. Note that **`FOXXYCODE_HOOK_TESTS=full`** goes through **`make test`**, whose **`ui-build`** step is known to fail on some Windows setups — **`fast`** is the practical opt-in there.

## Documentation contract

Human prose for HTTP lives in **`docs/http-api.md`**. Visual spec for SPA lives in **`DESIGN.md`** (this repo root). Architectural narrative remains under **`docs/architecture.md`**.

All **code comments** plus **technical markdown authored for this repo** (including `docs/`, `DESIGN.md`, `AGENTS.md`) stay **English** unless an operator explicitly asks for another natural language.

## Codex, OpenCode, Cursor and ZCode rules

Codex uses this **`AGENTS.md`** file as its repo instruction entrypoint, and ZCode resolves its `AGENTS.md` chain the same way. The detailed project rules live in **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`**, which is their single source of truth. Do not copy rules into `.codex/`, `.claude/`, or `.zcode/` by hand.

Codex resolves its `AGENTS.md` chain once per session, walking from the repository root down to the launch directory, so nested instruction files never load for a session started at the root. A lifecycle hook covers that gap and delivers the Cursor rules deterministically instead of asking the model to fetch them:

- **`.codex/hooks.json`** wires **`.codex/hooks/attach_rules.py`** to `SessionStart` and to `PreToolUse` on `apply_patch` / `Edit` / `Write`.
- On session start the hook injects every rule with `alwaysApply: true`.
- Before each patch it injects the rules whose `globs` cover the files being touched, at most once per rule per session.
- The hook parses `.mdc` frontmatter directly, so adding, renaming, or removing a rule file needs no change here. It fails open, and a malformed rule never blocks an edit.

The hook **reads** `.cursor/rules/` at run time and copies nothing, so that directory stays the single source of truth.

When working in OpenCode, the project plugin **`.opencode/plugins/project-rules.js`** delivers the same rule set without copying it. It injects `alwaysApply: true` rules into every model request, activates scoped rules when a tool touches a path covered by their `globs`, and preserves the active set through compaction. If a write tool is the first operation to reveal a new scoped rule, the plugin rejects that one call so OpenCode can retry with the rule in its model context. See **`docs/opencode-hooks.md`** and run **`make test-opencode-rules`** after changing the plugin.

ZCode loads its `AGENTS.md` chain the same way and has the same gap, so a parallel hook delivers the Cursor rules there too:

- **`.zcode/config.json`** wires **`.zcode/hooks/attach_rules.py`** to `SessionStart` and to `PreToolUse` on `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` / `ApplyPatch`, under `hooks.events` with `hooks.enabled: true`.
- The behaviour matches the Codex hook (always-on rules at session start, scoped rules per edit, once per rule per session, fail open). The single difference is how edited paths are recovered: ZCode carries them as JSON fields of `tool_input` (`file_path`, `path`, ...), so this variant walks those fields instead of parsing an `apply_patch` blob.
- Configuration-file hooks need no per-hook approval: a workspace config with `enabled: true` runs unconditionally. The command invokes `python` (not `python3`) because the `python3` name is a no-op Microsoft Store stub on Windows. The full guide, including how to probe the hook by hand and the Windows interpreter note, is **`docs/zcode-hooks.md`**.

Codex requires explicit approval for hooks and tracks them by content hash. Run **`/hooks`** once per clone, and again after editing `attach_rules.py`, otherwise the hook is skipped silently. Project-local hooks also load only when the `.codex/` layer is trusted. **`.codex/rules.md`** keeps the human-readable index of the rule files; the full guide, including how to probe the hook by hand, is **`docs/codex-hooks.md`**.

## Code Review Rules

Codex code review reads this section and applies it to changed files. Keep entries behavioural and repository-specific; formatting and lint stay in CI, where the pre-commit gate already runs **`make lint`**.

### HTTP surface

- Do not change routes, request or response shapes, or status codes in `external/httpserver/server.go` without updating `external/httpserver/openapi.go` in the same change. The served spec is what `/docs/` and generated clients consume, so drift is a silent API break. Safe path: update both, then reconcile `docs/http-api.md`.

### Build tags

- Do not let a package that builds by default import one that lives behind the `http`, `ui`, `scheduler`, `memory`, or `gateway` tags. Plain `make build` must keep compiling with the lean dependency set. Safe path: put the new code behind the same tag, or invert the dependency into an interface owned by the core package.

### Project-local configuration

- Do not read, merge, or execute project-local configuration (`.foxxycode/mcp.json`, MCP server definitions, hook scripts) without routing it through `TrustGate` in `internal/mcp`. Opening an untrusted checkout must not by itself grant code execution. Safe path: gate the read on the workspace trust decision and persist the approval through `TrustStore`.

### Embedded UI

- Do not treat a UI change as complete when only `external/ui/src/` moved. The binary serves `go:embed` assets, so unrebuilt sources ship the previous SPA. Safe path: run `make build TAGS="http ui"` and include the regenerated assets in the change.

### Text encoding

- Do not add a second decoder for workspace file bytes. `internal/textenc` is the one place an encoding is decided, and the file tools reach it through `decodeText` in `internal/tools/fs`. A local `utf8.Valid` check or a hardcoded charmap makes Windows-1251 sources unreadable in one tool while another reads them fine. Safe path: call `textenc.Decode` and carry the returned `Encoding` back into `Encode` when rewriting the file.

## HTTP API development flow

When changing behavior for the OpenAI-compatible HTTP gateway or bundled UI:

- Add or update tests first (red), then implement (green). The **happy path** of a feature (and a bug's reproduction) is a Gherkin spec in the repo-root **`features/`** directory, run by a godog harness (e.g. `external/httpserver/bdd_*_test.go`, pointing `Options.Paths` at `../../features/<name>.feature`); **edge/error cases go in ordinary unit tests**, not `features/`.
- If the external HTTP surface changes, update `external/httpserver/openapi.go` so the served OpenAPI matches handlers in `external/httpserver/server.go`.
- Keep `docs/http-api.md` aligned with the live behavior.
- For UI changes, update sources under **`external/ui/src/`** and rebuild embedded assets via **`make build TAGS="http ui"`** (runs **npm** via **make ui-build**).
- **Every** UI edit in a PR ships with a screenshot of the surface it changed (before/after when the surface already existed) — see step 5 of **`.claude/rules/workflow.md`**. If a surface cannot be captured, say so in the PR instead of omitting it.
- Run full regression `make test`, then `make lint`.

## UI sources (`external/ui/`)

**`DESIGN.md`** is the contract for layout, tokens, and SPA component behavior. After changing **`external/ui/src/`**, rebuild embedded assets with **`make build TAGS="http ui"`** before relying on **`go:embed`**.

The composer exposes **`Mode`** (**`agent`** / **`plan`** / **`docs`** / **`ask`**) and a separate **`Model`** YAML backend selector (**`metadata.model`**; list rows with **`owned_by`** other than **`foxxycode`** from **`GET /v1/models`**). Default YAML id comes from **`default_agent_model`**; persisted preference uses cookie **`foxxycode_llm_model`**. Parallel **`POST /v1/responses`** per session, **Stop** (**cancel** + partial assistant persistence), and transcript merge after **`GET .../messages`** are specified in **`DESIGN.md`** (**Multi-session streaming and Stop**) and **`docs/ui.md`**.

**`MarkdownLineEditor`** (`external/ui/src/ui/markdown/`) is the shared markdown body editor (line gutter, wrap-aware numbering, active-line highlight, content-driven height). Used in the plan document card and scheduler job body. Visual and behaviour contract: **`DESIGN.md`** (**Markdown line editor**, **Plan mode plan document card**); functional checklist: **`docs/ui.md`**.

## Python samples (`examples/`)

See **`examples/README.md`** for layout (**`examples/httpserver/`**, **`examples/acp/`**, **`examples/shared/`**). Scripts may use a project-local interpreter (`.venv` recommended); follow each script header for prerequisites.

- **`examples/build_foxxycode.sh`** - runs **`make build TAGS="http scheduler memory"`** (override **`TAGS`** as needed) and prints **`foxxycode -v`**.
- **`examples/test_acp.sh`** - wrapper that runs **`examples/acp/test_acp.sh`** (all ACP **`acp_*.py`** demos in one pass).
- **`examples/test_httpserver.sh`** - wrapper that runs **`examples/httpserver/test_httpserver.sh`** (temp **`foxxycode http`**, all HTTP harnesses including **`http_e2e_scheduler_api`** and **`http_e2e_scheduler_agent`**).

Example HTTP scripts that call completion endpoints expect a reachable provider and return non-zero on HTTP errors.
