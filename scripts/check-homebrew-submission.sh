# Preflight for the homebrew/core submission.
#
# Homebrew's acceptance criteria are checkable from the outside, and most of a
# rejected pull request is spent on things a script can answer first: whether the
# token is free, whether the repository clears the notability threshold for the
# kind of submission being made, whether the rendered formula is valid Ruby and
# names a real release. This runs those checks and prints the submission steps
# for a macOS host, where `brew audit` can finish the job.
#
# Nothing here talks to Homebrew's repositories other than reading them, and
# nothing is pushed or opened; the last section is the manual procedure.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-homebrew-submission.sh [options]
#
#   --version VER   release to check (default: `make -s print-version`)
#   --repo OWNER/N  upstream repository (default: hijera/foxxy-agent)
#   --token NAME    Homebrew token to claim (default: foxxycode)
#   --self          notability as a self-submission by the repository owner
#                   (the default; --third-party for a submission by someone else)
#   --third-party   notability as a submission by an unaffiliated contributor
