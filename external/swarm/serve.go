// Package swarm implements the stateless relay nodes register into.

// The relay itself is behind the swarm build tag. This file is not: it carries
// the options a caller fills in and the flag that says whether this binary can
// relay at all, so `foxxycode serve` can read a configuration that asks for a relay
// and answer honestly in a build that has none.
