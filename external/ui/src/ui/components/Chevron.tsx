/**
 * The app's one chevron: the fold marker a transcript row opens with, pointing
 * right while closed and turning down when open. A dropdown indicator points
 * down while closed and up when open. Every disclosure, submenu and dropdown
 * uses it rather than a glyph of its own; the visual contract is DESIGN.md
 * (Chevron), held by chevronContract.test.tsx.
 *
 * It is drawn, not typed. As the text glyph "›" its ink sat wherever the
 * platform's font put it inside the line box - a different place on every
 * machine - and no amount of nudging `top` could centre it everywhere. The
 * polyline below mirrors about the centre of its viewBox on both axes, so the
 * ink is centred in the box by construction and the box is what the CSS places.
