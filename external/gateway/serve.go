// Package gateway provides a pluggable messenger gateway for FoxxyCode Agent.
//
// The adapters are behind the gateway build tags. This file is not: it carries
// the options a caller fills in and the flag that says whether this binary has
// any adapter at all, so `foxxycode serve` can read a configuration that asks for a
// bot and answer honestly in a build that has none.
