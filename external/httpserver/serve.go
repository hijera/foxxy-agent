// Package httpserver implements an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API for FoxxyCode.
//
// The API itself is behind the http build tag. This file is not: it carries the
// options a caller fills in and the flag that says whether this binary can serve
// at all, so `foxxycode serve` can read a configuration that asks for the API and
// answer honestly in a build that has none.
