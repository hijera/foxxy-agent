// The strict OpenAI view of a foxxycode turn.
//
// The SSE bridge speaks one stream for every surface: OpenAI-shaped text chunks
// plus the named event: frames the SPA, the remote console and the swarm relay
// read (tool_call, token_usage, foxxycode_meta, ...). POST /v1/chat/completions is
// the one surface whose reader is not ours - VS Code Copilot wired in through
// chatLanguageModels.json, the openai SDKs - and those parse chat.completion.chunk
// literally: a completion ends on the chunk that carries finish_reason, and every
// data: line is expected to be a chunk. The bridge never sent the former, and the
// named events were read as chunks with no choices at all (issue #183).
//
// openAIStreamFilter sits between the bridge and that client's socket and renders
// the same turn as the contract those clients implement. It is a view, not a mode:
// the bridge still writes the whole foxxycode stream, so a relay behind a teeSSEWriter -
// and every watcher on it - sees exactly what it saw before.
//
// The bridge's own chunks carry a delta and nothing else - no finish_reason, no
// empty choices, no role - and the filter is what turns them into a completion
// with exactly one finish. Should a chunk ever arrive already finished, that
// finish is the completion's and none is added; a chunk with no choice at all is
// not a chunk and is dropped.
//
// A named event leaves an SSE comment in its place. The bridge's idle keepalive
// counts every frame it writes as traffic, named events included, so a tool phase
// that keeps announcing progress never looks idle to it - and the client's socket,
// which no longer carries those frames, would sit silent for the whole phase
// until a proxy in front of foxxycode dropped it. Every parser skips a comment, and
// the socket stays exactly as busy as the turn.
