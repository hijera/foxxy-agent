// Operator gates: the permission and question modals a worker blocks on.
//
// A background subagent asks whenever it needs to - between turns, or while a
// turn's own prompt is already on screen - so a gate that arrives while another
// is open waits its turn instead of replacing it, which would leave the first
// asker blocked with nothing left to answer. A gate whose asker gave up (its
// turn was cancelled, the subagent was stopped, another surface answered first)
// is taken down, or skipped if it never reached the screen.
