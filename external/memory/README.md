# Long-term memory (Memory Copilot)

Implementation for Coddy lives in this directory (`external/memory`) and is **always linked** into the main `coddy` binary. Use **`memory.enabled`** in `config.yaml` to turn behavior on or off at runtime. There is no separate memory-only build.

## Build

`make build` produces `build/coddy` (see the Makefile header for optional **`TAGS`** and other build notes).

## Behaviour

In the LLM sense, “memory” is whatever is injected into the context. Short-term memory is the chat history. **Long-term** memory here means markdown files on disk that are turned into a short block **before** the main model answers, merged into the same template slot as session notes (`{{.Memory}}` in `agent.md` / `plan.md`).

When `memory.enabled` is true, Coddy also emits **ACP `session/update`** notifications (`memory_phase`, `memory_message_chunk`) and persists a per-session **`memory_trace.json`** alongside `messages.json`. That trace and the HTTP **`memoryTurns`** field on **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/messages`** are for UI observability only - they are **not** part of the Chat Completions transcript sent to the primary model.

A separate **memory copilot** (extra `llm.Stream` / completion passes) may call only `coddy_memory_*` tools:

- **Recall** (before the main reply) - search/read (and optional save/delete inside that sub-loop). Output is stored in a per-turn session field and merged with user session notes when rendering the system prompt.
- **Persist** (after the final assistant message in a user turn, when there are no pending tool calls) - a judge returns JSON; on approval, a new `.md` file is written.

The main ReAct loop **does not** receive these tool definitions and cannot call memory as a normal tool.

## Storage layout

- **Global** (shared across sessions): `memory.dir` in config. When `dir` is empty or unset, the root is **`$CODDY_HOME/memory`** (typically `~/.coddy/memory`). Values support `${CODDY_HOME}` and `~` expansion like other paths in config.
- **Project** (per workspace): always **`<session cwd>/memory`**. This path is not configurable.

Supported file extensions: `.md` and `.txt`. `coddy_memory_search` ranks files by word overlap with the latest user message text.

## Configuration (`memory`)

See `config.example.yaml` and `docs/config.md`. Fields:

- `enabled` - master switch at runtime.
- `model` - optional selector from `models[]` for copilot calls; empty uses the active session / `agent.model`.
- `dir`, `recall_max_turns`, `persist_max_turns`, `copilot_max_tokens`, `max_search_hits` - see the example config comments.

## Cost and latency

Each user turn with memory enabled adds at least one recall LLM call when any memory files exist, plus a judge call when the turn ends cleanly. Both use English system prompts defined in this package.

## Code layout

- `store.go` - roots, search, read, write, delete.
- `tools.go` - tool schemas and execution.
- `copilot.go` - recall loop with `llm.Complete` and persist after the judge.

Runtime wiring: `internal/agent/memory_hooks.go` imports this package.
