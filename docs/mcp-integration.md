# MCP Server Integration

## Overview

The agent supports connecting to external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, which provide
additional tools and resources. MCP servers can be configured at these levels:

1. **Global** (scope `global`) - `mcp_servers` in `config.yaml` and the user-global
   `~/.foxxycode/mcp.json` (the analogue of Cursor's `~/.cursor/mcp.json`), connected for every
   session; entries in `~/.foxxycode/mcp.json` override same-named `config.yaml` entries
2. **Local** (scope `local`) - `<workspace>/.foxxycode/mcp.json`, merged over the global list for
   sessions in that workspace; a local entry with the same name overrides the global definition
3. **Per-session** - provided by the ACP client in `session/new` parameters

Tools from all connected MCP servers are merged into the tool list passed to the LLM during
the ReAct loop (in **`agent`** and **`plan`** modes). Ask exposes only tools whose MCP definition
declares **`annotations.readOnlyHint: true`**, and hides all MCP tools when
**`tools.ask_disable_extended_tools`** is enabled.

## mcp.json (global and local)

Both mcp.json files use the same shape as Cursor's: a single `mcpServers` object keyed by
server name. `env` and `headers` are JSON objects (not the YAML name/value list), and
per-tool switches use `disabledTools`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "${CWD}"],
      "env": { "SOME_TOKEN": "value" },
      "disabled": false,
      "disabledTools": ["write_file"]
    }
  }
}
```

A broken `mcp.json` is logged and skipped; the session still starts with the remaining levels.

## Enable / disable switches

Every config level supports switching off a whole server or individual tools without
removing their definitions:

- `config.yaml`: `disabled: true` and `disabled_tools: ["tool_a"]` per `mcp_servers` entry
- `~/.foxxycode/mcp.json` and `./.foxxycode/mcp.json`: `"disabled": true` and
  `"disabledTools": ["tool_a"]` per entry

Disabled servers are not connected for new sessions. Disabled tools (and all tools of a
disabled server) are hidden from the LLM's tool list and rejected at dispatch. The switches
are re-read on every agent turn, so toggling them (by editing the files or through the
HTTP API / web UI below) also applies to **already running** sessions on their next turn.

## Management API and UI

The HTTP gateway (build tag `http`) exposes the merged server list with probed tool
inventories and toggle endpoints under **`/foxxycode/mcp*`** (see `docs/http-api.md`), and the
bundled web UI shows them under **Settings -> MCP servers**: status dot per server, a
`global` / `local` scope badge, expandable tool list with per-tool switches, and a
Cursor-style JSON editor for mcp.json entries with a scope picker (global writes
`~/.foxxycode/mcp.json`, local writes `./.foxxycode/mcp.json`). Toggles persist into the file that
defines the server; `config.yaml` entries are toggle-only here and edited in Settings.

## Supported Transports

### stdio (supported)

The MCP server runs as a subprocess. Communication via stdin/stdout (newline-delimited
JSON-RPC 2.0).

Configuration in `session/new`:
```json
{
  "name": "my-server",
  "command": "/path/to/mcp-server",
  "args": ["--stdio"],
  "env": [
    { "name": "API_KEY", "value": "secret" }
  ]
}
```

Configuration in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: "filesystem"
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user/projects"]
    env: []
```

### Streamable HTTP (supported)

`type: http` connects to `url` over the
MCP streamable HTTP transport (2025-03-26 spec): JSON-RPC messages are POSTed to the
endpoint and answered as `application/json` bodies or `text/event-stream` chunks; the
`Mcp-Session-Id` issued on initialize is echoed on subsequent requests. `headers` are sent
with every request (e.g. `Authorization`). URL-only entries (no `command`, no `type`)
default to `http`. When the endpoint rejects the handshake (legacy servers answer POST
with 4xx), the client automatically falls back to the legacy SSE transport at the same
URL, mirroring Cursor and Claude Code behavior. The agent advertises
`mcpCapabilities.http: true` and `mcpCapabilities.sse: true`. In YAML the `type` value
must be `stdio`, `http`, or `sse`; mcp.json and ACP entries additionally accept the
`streamable-http` / `streamable_http` aliases for `http`.

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: "remote-tools"
    type: "http"
    url: "https://mcp.example.com/mcp"
    headers:
      - name: "Authorization"
        value: "Bearer ${MCP_TOKEN}"
```

### SSE (supported, legacy)

`type: sse` forces the 2024-11-05 HTTP+SSE transport: a GET stream at `url` announces the
POST endpoint in its first event and then carries every server-to-client message. Use it
for servers that only implement the older protocol; `type: http` reaches them too via the
automatic fallback.

In `.foxxycode/mcp.json` the same entries look like Cursor's:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-tools": { "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp" },
    "legacy-tools": { "type": "sse", "url": "https://old.example.com/sse" }
  }
}
```

## Tool Namespacing

To avoid conflicts when multiple MCP servers provide tools with the same name,
tools are namespaced using the server name:

- MCP server `filesystem` providing tool `read_file` -> available as `filesystem__read_file`
- Built-in tool `read_file` -> available as `read_file`

Because `__` separates the server and tool parts, server names must not contain `__`
(the management API rejects such names).

## How tools reach the model

MCP tools are **not** injected into the system prompt text (unlike skills, which render
into a prompt section). They join the built-in tools in the native function-calling
`tools` array of every LLM request, one definition per enabled tool: name
`server__tool`, the server's own `inputSchema`, and the description prefixed with
`[server]` so the model can tell providers apart. When the model emits a tool call whose
name contains `__`, the agent routes it to the owning server over its transport and
returns the MCP result to the model as a regular tool observation - the same loop as
built-in tools, and the same approach Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor use. The end-to-end
happy path (two servers over stdio and streamable HTTP, the model picking one by its
namespaced tool, the result landing in the final answer) is specified in
`features/mcp_tool_calls.feature` for both the OpenAI-compatible HTTP surface and the
ACP session flow.

## Permission Model

MCP tool calls are currently dispatched without the built-in permission prompts that guard
filesystem writes and shell commands; the disable switches above are the mechanism for
restricting what a server may do. Prefer running MCP servers with least-privilege
credentials and disabling tools you do not need.

## Popular MCP Servers

### Filesystem access
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: "filesystem"
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "${CWD}"]   # session cwd when the server starts
```

### GitHub
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: "github"
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    env:
      - name: "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
        value: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
```

### Postgres database
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: "postgres"
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "${DATABASE_URL}"]
```

### Brave Search
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: "brave-search"
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"]
    env:
      - name: "BRAVE_API_KEY"
        value: "${BRAVE_API_KEY}"
```

## MCP Server Lifecycle

1. On `session/new`, the agent connects every enabled server from the merged
   config.yaml + `~/.foxxycode/mcp.json` + `./.foxxycode/mcp.json` list, then any ACP
   client-supplied servers
2. The agent calls `tools/list` on each server and registers the tools
3. During the ReAct loop, when LLM calls an MCP tool, the agent forwards the call
   (unless the tool or its server has been disabled since)
4. Results are returned to the LLM as tool observations
5. On session end or `session/cancel`, MCP server connections are cleaned up

## Error Handling

- If an MCP server fails to start, the session still proceeds with a warning
- Failed MCP tool calls return an error observation to the LLM
- The LLM can decide to retry, use alternative tools, or inform the user
