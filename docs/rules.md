# Project rules

FoxxyCode discovers project rules from the session working directory and injects them into the system prompt via **`{{.Rules}}`**, separate from skills (**`{{.Skills}}`**).

## Prompt order

From top to bottom in the rendered system message:

1. Tools
2. Skills
3. Plan context / todo list (mode-dependent)
4. **Rules** (project docs + active rules)
5. Session memory
6. Current UTC time

## Discovery

When `rules.auto_discover` is true (default), FoxxyCode scans:

| System | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `foxxycode` | `.foxxyrules` / `.foxyrules` (single file **or** directory), and `.foxxycode/rules/` | FoxxyCode's own roots; the top-level single file is described below |
| `agents-dir` | `.agents/rules/` | The tool-neutral `.agents/` tree, next to `.agents/skills`: rules meant for every agent that works on the project |
| `cursor` | `.cursor/rules/` | |
| `claude` | `.claude/rules/` | |
| `codex` | `.codex/rules/` | Markdown only in v1; Codex's own `*.rules` policy files are not prompt rules |
| `agents` | nested `**/AGENTS.md` | [agents.md](https://agents.md/) convention; hidden dirs, `node_modules`, `vendor` skipped; discovered eagerly, **loaded on demand** (see Activation) |

Every markdown root is scanned recursively for `.md` and `.mdc` files. Duplicate rule files (same file name, extension included) resolve with precedence: **foxxycode > agents-dir > cursor > claude > codex > agents**. A project that keeps its rules in `.agents/rules/` therefore overrides tool-specific copies of the same file, and `.foxxycode/rules/` overrides everything. Nested `AGENTS.md` files are keyed by full path, so they never collapse into each other.

Nested `AGENTS.md` files are **directory-scoped**. Discovery finds them all, but a body enters **`{{.Rules}}`** only the first time a filesystem tool call or an attached `file://` path targets its directory or anything below it — then it **sticks** for the rest of the session. Every `AGENTS.md` on the ancestor chain of a touched path activates together, so reading `a/b/c/f.go` pulls in `a/AGENTS.md`, `a/b/AGENTS.md`, and `a/b/c/AGENTS.md`. `run_command` does not activate anything: a shell string cannot be attributed to a directory reliably.

This is what keeps a repo with vendored sibling checkouts usable — 45 nested files loaded unconditionally cost ~131k tokens of system prompt before the first question. Bodies over 256 KB are truncated, as with the project docs preamble.

The **root** `AGENTS.md` is not part of this set — it already enters the prompt unconditionally as a project docs preamble (below).

### `.foxxyrules` / `.foxyrules` (top-level project rules)

Cline-style top-level project rules. Each root is accepted as **either** a single file **or** a directory:

- **Single file** (`.foxxyrules` / `.foxyrules`) without frontmatter is **always-loaded** for the session. With frontmatter it honors `globs` / `alwaysApply` like any other rule.
- **Directory** (`.foxxyrules/*.md`) loads its markdown files like the `.foxxycode/rules/` catalog.
- `.foxyrules` (one `x`) is an exact alias of `.foxxyrules`. Both count as the **FoxxyCode** source and win basename ties over cursor/claude/codex/agents.

CLI: `foxxycode rules list [--cwd DIR]` prints the discovered catalog: the source folder (`SOURCE`), the dialect each file was read with (`FORMAT`), the activation mode (`APPLY`: `auto` or `mention`), whether the rule is in every prompt (`ALWAYS`: an auto rule with no patterns and no directory scope) and what activates the others (`ACTIVATES ON`).

## Rule file formats

The file extension selects the dialect a rule is read with. Both dialects are accepted in every root, so `.agents/rules/` can hold Cursor and Claude Code rules side by side and a file copied from `.cursor/rules/` or `.claude/rules/` keeps its meaning.

| Extension | Format | Frontmatter keys | Header without `alwaysApply` and without patterns |
|-----------|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `.mdc` | Cursor ([docs](https://cursor.com/docs/rules)) | `description`, `globs` (comma-separated string or a list), `alwaysApply` | Manual: Cursor defaults `alwaysApply` to false, so the body enters only on **`@name`** |
| `.md` | Claude Code ([docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#organize-rules-with-clauderules)) | `paths` (list of globs), optional `description` | Loaded unconditionally, as Claude Code does |

Shared by both dialects:

- A file without frontmatter is active from the first turn.
- Patterns (`globs` or `paths`; either key is accepted in either dialect) gate the rule: the body enters the prompt the first time a matching file comes into play, then sticks. This is Cursor's auto-attach and Claude Code's path scoping; FoxxyCode applies the same gate to `alwaysApply: true` rules that carry patterns, to keep the prompt small.
- An explicit `alwaysApply` is the master switch for a header without patterns: `true` is active immediately, `false` is mention-only.
- CRLF line endings, quoted or unquoted values, `[flow, lists]`, `- item` lists and trailing `# comments` are all read.

Cursor's `.mdc` headers are frequently not valid YAML: `globs: **/*.go` starts with the YAML alias character. FoxxyCode reads a header as YAML first and falls back to a line reader that knows these keys, so such a file keeps its description, globs and `alwaysApply` instead of being treated as if it had no frontmatter.

```markdown
---
description: HTTP layer conventions
globs: external/httpserver/**/*.go, docs/http-api.md
alwaysApply: false
---
```

```markdown
---
description: HTTP layer conventions
paths:
  - "external/httpserver/**/*.go"
  - "docs/http-api.md"
---
```

The two headers above mean the same thing in `http-layer.mdc` and `http-layer.md`: auto-attached once one of those files is attached or touched.

### Glob patterns

Patterns follow Cursor and Claude Code: `*` matches within one path segment, `**` any number of directories, `{a,b}` alternatives, `[abc]` character classes. They are anchored at the project root (the session cwd): a file is matched by its path relative to the root, so `internal/**/*.go` matches `internal/agent/react.go` but not `external/x.go`, `*.md` names markdown files in the root only (use `**/*.md` for any depth), and a file outside the workspace, such as a sibling checkout or a module cache, never matches anything. In `.mdc` files several patterns are separated by commas (`docs/**/*.md, README.md`); a comma inside braces (`*.{ts,tsx}`) does not split.

### Upgrading from earlier releases

Rule files already on disk may change mode after this release; `foxxycode rules list` shows the result.

- `alwaysApply: false` together with `globs` is auto-attached once a matching file is attached or read. Earlier releases kept such a rule mention-only. Drop the `globs` to keep a rule manual.
- `.md` rules without `alwaysApply` follow Claude Code: unconditional without `paths`, path-gated with them. Earlier releases treated them as mention-only. Write `alwaysApply: false` to keep a `.md` rule manual.
- A directory-less pattern such as `*.go` matches files in the project root only. Earlier releases matched it against the file name at any depth; write `**/*.go` for that.
- Cursor headers that are not valid YAML (`globs: **/*.go`) are now read. Earlier releases dropped the whole header, so those rules were always on with no globs; they now honour their `alwaysApply` and wait for their globs like any other rule.

## Activation

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Patterns (`globs` / `paths`), any `alwaysApply` | Body enters **`{{.Rules}}`** the first time a matching file comes into play: a `file://` attachment in the user message, or a filesystem tool call (`read`, `edit`, `grep`, ...) targeting a matching path. Then **sticks** for the rest of the session |
| `alwaysApply: true` without patterns | Active immediately for the session |
| `alwaysApply: false` without patterns | **Never** auto-included. Body only when **`@ruleName`** appears in the user message |
| No `alwaysApply`, no patterns, `.mdc` | Mention-only (Cursor's default) |
| No `alwaysApply`, no patterns, `.md` | Active immediately (Claude Code loads it unconditionally) |
| No frontmatter | Active immediately |
| Nested `AGENTS.md` | Directory-scoped. Body enters **`{{.Rules}}`** after the first filesystem tool call or `file://` path inside its directory, then **sticks** for the session |

Mention-only rules use **`@name`** (file stem). They are **not** slash commands and do not appear in the skills catalog. `run_command` activates nothing: a shell string cannot be attributed to a path reliably.

## Project docs preamble

On every turn, if present in session CWD:

- **`AGENTS.md`** (subsection `### AGENTS.md`)
- **`DESIGN.md`** (subsection `### DESIGN.md`)

These are unconditional; they do not use `alwaysApply` or `@mention`.

## Generating rules

Use the bundled skill **`/generate-rules`**. It is always available (embedded in the binary) and guides the agent to write focused rule files via filesystem tools, into `.cursor/rules/` when the project already has one, into `.agents/rules/` when the project keeps shared agent configuration there, otherwise into `.foxxycode/rules/`.

There is no `foxxycode rules generate` CLI subcommand.

## Context breakdown (UI)

After each agent turn, FoxxyCode estimates tokens per category (`systemPrompt`, `toolDefinitions`, `rules`, `skills`, `mcp`, `conversation`) and exposes them on **`GET /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/stats`** as `contextBreakdown`. The composer context ring opens a breakdown popover on click.

## Configuration

```yaml
rules:
  auto_discover: true
  systems: []   # optional filter: foxxycode, agents-dir, cursor, claude, codex, agents
```
