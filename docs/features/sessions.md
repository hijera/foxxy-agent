# Sessions

A session is one conversation: the transcript, the working directory it runs in, the mode, model and permission mode it uses, its todo checklist, the files uploaded into it and the tool activity it produced. Every surface - the console, the web UI, an ACP editor, the Telegram gateway, a scheduler run, a subagent - works on the same kind of session, stored the same way, so a conversation started in one place can be continued in another. This page covers the bundle on disk, resuming, branches from an edited message, the todo checklist, child sessions and the `foxxycode sessions` command. Writing a transcript to a file is [Session export](session-export.md).

## The bundle on disk

Every session is a directory under the sessions root, `$FOXXYCODE_HOME/sessions/<id>/` (`~/.foxxycode/sessions/` by default). The root moves with `sessions.dir` in `config.yaml` or with `--sessions-dir` on `foxxycode serve`, `foxxycode acp`, the console and the `foxxycode sessions` verbs ([config.yaml reference](../reference/config.md#sessions)); the process creates it at start and fails to start when it cannot.

Ids are `sess_` followed by 24 hex characters, whoever started the session: a console run, a browser tab, a chat on a messenger gateway, a subagent run another session spawned. Where a person was sitting is not something a session id reports, so nothing downstream can branch on it; scheduler runs are the one exception, `sched_` ids written by the scheduler's own bookkeeping. An id doubles as the folder name, so only letters, digits, `_` and `-` are accepted.

A session spawned by another one is stored inside it, at `<parent>/subagents/<child>/`, and a child of that child one level deeper again, so the sessions root lists the conversations a person started and each bundle carries the work it delegated. What a bundle is - a chat, a delegated run, a scheduler run - is in its `session.json`, not in its name.

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `session.json` | id, `cwd`, `mode`, the session's model and reasoning overrides, the permission-mode override, the title (derived, or pinned by the user), the `tags` it is filed under, whether it is `pinned` (with `pinnedAt` and `pinnedRank`) and whether it is `archived` (with `archivedAt`), `updatedAt`, the context handed over by `SessionStart` hooks, the run metadata of a scheduler or subagent bundle, and the activity counters behind the unread dot |
| `messages.json` | the transcript the model sees: `user`, `assistant` and `tool` rows, compaction summaries included; hooks receive its path as `transcript_path` |
| `assets/` | files uploaded through the composer, saved read-only, with PNG previews under `thumbnails/` |
| `todos/active.md` | the current todo checklist; `todos/archive/` keeps replaced and archived lists |
| `plans/<slug>.plan.md` | design plans written in plan mode |
| `tool_calls/<id>/` | `args.json`, `result.md` and `meta.json` of every tool call, so a full result can be fetched after the stream showed a preview. The id is the model provider's, so it names the folder only while it is a plain single name (letters, digits, `_`, `.`, `-`, at most 128 characters); anything else - a separator, a traversal, an id longer than a file name - is stored under a digest of it instead, and `meta.json` carries the `toolCallId` the provider sent either way |
| `stats.json` | token totals of the completed model calls |
| `branches.json` | the branch points of an edited conversation |
| `diffs/turn_<n>.json` | the workspace files each turn changed, replayed backwards when a branch is created |
| `background/<task_id>/` | the record and output log of every background task and subagent run |
| `memory_trace.json` | what the memory copilot did on each turn ([Long-term memory](memory.md)) |
| `ui_log.json`, `permission_grants.json`, `pending_permission.json` | notice rows shown in the transcript, the commands and write targets approved with "allow always", a permission prompt waiting for its answer over HTTP |
| `pending_plan_context.json` | the design plan text handed to the turn a plan run started, kept until that turn is over. A turn stopped on a permission prompt is continued after the answer arrives, sometimes in another process, and renders the same system prompt again ([Plan mode](modes.md)) |

Compaction and result eviction never rewrite a bundle: both are projections built when a request goes to the model, and `messages.json` keeps every original row ([Context compaction](compaction.md)).

## What a session remembers

The mode (`agent`, `plan` or `ask`), the model, the reasoning level and the permission mode are session-scoped overrides persisted in `session.json`: the ACP `session/set_mode` and `session/set_config_option` methods, the composer's Mode, Model and Reasoning selectors (`PATCH /foxxycode/sessions/{id}` with `selectedModelId` or `selectedReasoning`) and the console's `/mode` and `ctrl+l` all write there, and a session-level `permission_mode` outranks `tools.permission_mode` from the configuration. The working directory is recorded too: `foxxycode -c`, the console picker and `foxxycode sessions list --cwd` filter on it. The web UI picks the folder, the git branch and an optional worktree before the first message and locks them once the transcript has messages ([Web UI](../surfaces/web-ui.md#per-session-workspace-folder--branch--worktree--svn-chips)). The title is derived from the first prompt until you pin one, inline in the chat header or with `PATCH /foxxycode/sessions/{id}` and a `title`; the same route carries the `tags` and the `archived` flag described below.

## Tags and the archive

A history that has grown for months is narrowed rather than scrolled, and two fields on the bundle carry that.

**Tags** are a short flat vocabulary a session is filed under: lower case, inner whitespace as a hyphen, duplicates dropped, at most eight of at most thirty-two characters each. Nobody has to invent them. The call that names a new chat, `POST /foxxycode/describe`, asks the model for the phrase *and* one to three topic labels in the same answer, and the `PATCH` that pins the title carries them along - so filing costs no extra request, and a model that ignores the instruction simply names the chat as before. They are editable afterwards: `PATCH /foxxycode/sessions/{id}` with `tags` replaces the set wholesale, an empty array clears it, and omitting the field leaves it alone. The listing filters on them (`GET /foxxycode/sessions?tags=backend,ui` keeps a session carrying **any** of them), search matches them beside the title and the workspace, and History groups by them.

**Pinning** holds a conversation at the top of every listing, whatever it is sorted by: `PATCH /foxxycode/sessions/{id}` with `pinned` sets the flag and stamps `pinnedAt`, and a pin that only worked in one order would not be a pin. The pins are one list the operator keeps by hand - `pinnedRank` records the order they were dragged into (`POST /foxxycode/sessions/pins/reorder`), a new pin goes above the ones already there, and unpinning forgets the placement, so pinning again is a new pin rather than a return to an old seat.

**Archiving** takes a conversation out of the working list without taking it off disk. `PATCH /foxxycode/sessions/{id}` with `archived` sets the flag and stamps `archivedAt`; the default listing leaves those sessions out, `archived=only` is the archive and `archived=all` is everything. Nothing else changes: an archived session resumes, exports and branches exactly as it did. Emptying the archive is one request, `POST /foxxycode/sessions/bulk-delete` with `{"scope":"archived"}`, and the `all` scope still means the whole history, archive included.

**Where a session came from** is recorded too: `session.json` carries an `origin`, empty for a conversation opened on this host and `gateway:<messenger>` for one a messenger gateway is holding (`gateway:telegram` today). The surface that creates the session writes it once and nothing rewrites it afterwards, so reopening a Telegram chat from the web UI does not relabel it. `GET /foxxycode/sessions?origin=local` and `?origin=gateway` split the two.

All three are visible in the web UI ([Web UI](../surfaces/web-ui.md#session-list)): History has one menu for environment, archive status, grouping (date, folder or tag, with collapsible headings) and order, and the session table in **Settings -> Sessions** filters by archive, sorts by column, and has one button for emptying the archive.

## Git worktrees

A worktree FoxxyCode opens for a session goes to `<repo>/.foxxycode/worktrees/<branch>/` - inside the checkout, beside the rest of the project-local FoxxyCode state (`.foxxycode/rules`, `.foxxycode/agents`, `.foxxycode/mcp.json`), the way Claude Code and Codex keep theirs. The branch name is mapped to a folder name by replacing the characters a path cannot hold, so `feature/login` becomes `feature-login`.

The root carries its own `.gitignore` holding `*`, written when the first worktree is created and put back whenever it has gone missing. It sits beside the worktrees rather than inside them and ignores everything below it, the ignore file included, so the folder stays out of the **main** checkout's `git status` and nothing has to be added to the repository's own ignore list. It does not hide the work: inside a worktree, `git status` reports your edits as it should. An ignore file already at that path belongs to the operator and is never rewritten - if what it says does not cover the worktrees, they stay visible, and that is then the operator's call.

`.foxxycode` is repository content, so a checkout can ship it as a symlink pointing somewhere else. A worktrees root that resolves outside the checkout is refused rather than followed, and a branch name that reads as a git option (`--detach`) or maps to no usable folder name is refused before git sees it.

The flip side of living inside the checkout is that the folder is an ignored path in the main working copy, so `git clean` reaches it. Measured on git 2.47: `-xdf` skips the worktrees themselves ("skipping repository") but does delete the `.gitignore`, which FoxxyCode writes again with the next worktree; `-xdff` deletes the whole folder and leaves the entries behind as `prunable`. Run `git worktree list` before reaching for either, and `git worktree prune` after one went through.

Every entry is a whole checkout of another branch, so what walks the main checkout leaves the folder out: the file snapshot a turn takes for branch rollback, the `print_tree` tool, and the IntelliJ plugin, which excludes `<project>/.foxxycode/worktrees` from the index so symbols and search results do not show up once per worktree. A Subversion branch folder is not a worktree and has no self-ignoring equivalent, so it keeps living under `<home>/worktrees/<wc>/`. The same walkers skip the metadata of the version control client itself - `.git`, and `.svn` with its pristine copy of every file - so an `svn update` the agent ran is not something a branch rollback tries to undo.

The same place is what the agent is told to use for a worktree it creates by hand (`internal/prompts/sections/agent/git_worktrees.md`), so a branch opened from the composer and a branch opened by a shell command land side by side. The web UI opens one through the worktree checkbox ([Web UI](../surfaces/web-ui.md#per-session-workspace-folder--branch--worktree--svn-chips)); over HTTP it is `POST /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/workspace` with `{"branch":b,"worktree":true}` ([HTTP API](../reference/http-api.md)).

## One store, every surface

`foxxycode serve` runs one session manager over one store for the HTTP API, the web UI, the Telegram gateway and the scheduler, so a chat with the bot is an ordinary session that the History drawer lists and opens while it is happening, and a turn started on one surface is mirrored into a browser watching the same session ([foxxycode serve](../operate/serve.md), [Telegram gateway](../surfaces/gateway.md)). The console and `foxxycode acp` open the same store on their own; with `--remote` they work on the server's sessions instead of a local store. A swarm relay aggregates the session lists of its nodes ([Swarm](../operate/swarm.md)).

A session runs one turn at a time. The turn lock is a file lock on the bundle, so a second process - `foxxycode serve` while `foxxycode acp` holds the turn - is refused rather than interleaved (`409` over HTTP), and a cancel also writes a marker into the bundle that the process holding the turn picks up between its polls. Different sessions stream in parallel, each behind its own lock ([Web UI](../surfaces/web-ui.md#parallel-sessions-and-generation-cancel)).

Browsers and consoles connected through `--remote` to the same server can stop a turn or add and remove [queued follow-ups](message-queue.md), including a turn another client started. They recover activity and queue state when reconnecting; losing a stream connection does not mean the session stopped. A successful cancel response acknowledges the request, while the turn's completion confirms that its lock was released. HTTP profiles install their cancellation hook when they acquire that lock, before workspace preparation; a Stop in that window remains effective when the runner is admitted. Shared permission/question answers and a live foreign-turn transcript in the remote console are not part of these controls. Separate local processes sharing only the bundle still have separate queues and pending-answer channels.

## Resuming

| Surface | How |
|---|---|
| Console | `foxxycode -c` (`--continue`) reopens the most recent session recorded for the current folder and fails when there is none; `--session-id <id>` reopens that session or creates one under that id; `--resume` and `/resume` open a picker of the folder's sessions by title and last update; `-c -p "..."` continues in print mode. Quitting prints the id and the command that resumes it. Under `--remote` all of them work on the server's list, without the folder filter ([Console](../surfaces/console.md)). |
| Web UI | The **History** drawer (`#/history`) lists sessions newest first, with a search over the title and the first prompt, a spinner on a session still generating, a dot on one that finished while you were elsewhere and a question mark on one waiting for a permission; a row opens `#/s/<id>`, and that URL alone brings the session back ([Web UI](../surfaces/web-ui.md#session-list)). |
| ACP editors | `session/load` restores `session.json` and `messages.json`, replays the turns and the tool call summaries, sends a `plan` update when `todos/active.md` exists, then the command catalog; `session/list` lists the bundles with an optional `cwd` filter that matches the folder however its path is spelled, and `loadSession` is advertised whenever a store is configured. `foxxycode acp --session-id <id>` makes the next `session/new` reopen that bundle, or create one under that name ([ACP protocol](../reference/acp-protocol.md#sessionload)). |
| HTTP | `GET /foxxycode/sessions` (`limit`, `cursor`, `q`, `include_scheduler`, `include_subagents`, `include_activity`), `GET /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/messages`, and `X-FoxxyCode-Session-ID` on `POST /v1/responses` to continue a session ([HTTP API](../reference/http-api.md)). |

Listings sort by `updatedAt`, newest first; the stamp moves when something is persisted - a turn, a pinned title - and not when a bundle is merely loaded to serve a read. Reopening a session runs the `SessionStart` hooks again with `source: resume` ([Hooks](hooks.md#events)).

## Branches from an edited message

Editing a message you already sent does not overwrite the answer it produced. The pencil on a user bubble in the web UI loads that message back into the composer; sending it calls `POST /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/branches` with the 0-based index of the user message, and the server creates a new session holding every message before that point, reverses the workspace changes recorded by the turns after it so the files match the state the branch starts from, and sends the edited text to the new session. Both threads stay readable, and both are ordinary bundles that every surface can open.

The bookkeeping lives in `branches.json`. The source records a branch point at that message index with its threads in order - the source itself first, each fork after it, each with a preview of its message - and the new session records its origin: the parent, the index and its own position. Forking a branch at the same point where it diverged from its parent adds a sibling to the parent's branch point; forking it anywhere else opens a branch point of its own. Under the branch point the transcript shows a `‹ 2/2 ›` navigator whose arrows switch between the threads. Opening a session by id follows the most recently updated thread at every branch point, so a link to the root lands where you last worked; a thread picked in the navigator opens as picked. Deleting a thread retracts it from the parent's file, and a branch point left with a single thread disappears, so the navigator never points at a bundle that is gone.

`GET /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/branches` returns the branch points a session sees, its own and the sibling view inherited from its parent ([Web UI](../surfaces/web-ui.md#message-editing-and-conversation-branches)). Child sessions of subagents cannot be forked.

## The todo checklist

The `foxxycode_todo_*` tools (`plan_read`, `plan_replace`, `plan_archive`, `item_add`, `item_update`, `item_remove`, `item_move`, with the statuses `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed` and `cancelled`) keep the session's checklist. Every change is mirrored to `todos/active.md` and published to the client as a `plan` update, and while the list is non-empty the system prompt carries a `### Current todo checklist` block that is refreshed before every model call of the turn, so an item ticked mid-turn is visible at once. Ask mode offers no todo tools.

Two rules govern replacement. `foxxycode_todo_plan_replace` is refused while any item is not `completed` - finish the rows or archive first - and when every row is completed the previous `active.md` moves to `todos/archive/todo-<nanos>.md` before the new list is written. `foxxycode_todo_plan_archive` marks the open rows completed, writes `todos/archive/plan_<unix_seconds>.md` and clears the active list. Over HTTP the same list is `GET` and `PUT /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/plan`, and `POST /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/plan/archive`.

Design plans written in plan mode are separate files, `plans/<slug>.plan.md`, and never fill the checklist by themselves ([ACP protocol](../reference/acp-protocol.md#design-plans-plan-mode)).

## Child sessions and run bundles

A subagent run is a child session: a real bundle under `<parent>/subagents/<child>/` whose `session.json` carries `subagentRun`, `parentSessionId`, `subagentName`, `subagentTaskId` and `subagentDepth`. Children stay out of every default listing - History, `GET /foxxycode/sessions`, `foxxycode sessions list`, `foxxycode -c`, ACP `session/list` - and are read-only transcripts: a prompt, a fork or a permission answer against one is refused with the parent named ([Subagents](subagents.md#child-sessions)). Scheduler runs are bundles too, `sched_` ids with `schedulerRun` set, hidden from the composer list and pruned per job by `scheduler.retain_sessions` ([Scheduler](../operate/scheduler.md)).

## Deleting a session

The trash icon on a History row, after one confirmation, and `DELETE /foxxycode/sessions/{id}` remove the session tree: the session plus every child it spawned, their background tasks stopped first, the bundles removed deepest first. A deleted branch is retracted from the `branches.json` of the session it forked from. A running turn is cancelled and awaited before anything is removed. There is no delete verb on the command line; deleting the directory by hand is equivalent for a session no process holds.

## The sessions CLI

```bash
foxxycode sessions list [--sessions-dir <path>] [--cwd <filter>]
foxxycode sessions export <session-id> [--format md|html|json|jsonl] [--out <path>] [--no-tools] [--no-thinking] [--sessions-dir <path>]
```

`list` prints one tab-separated row per stored session - `SESSION_ID`, `UPDATED_AT`, `CWD`, `TITLE` - newest first, then `(total N)`; scheduler runs and child sessions are left out, and `--cwd` keeps only the sessions saved with that absolute directory. `export` writes a stored session's transcript to a file and accepts a unique id prefix in place of the full id; the formats, the path rules and the trimming options are in [Session export](session-export.md).

## Testing

- Executable specs in `features/`: `acp_session_integration.feature` (a reopened bundle replays its transcript after the `session/new` response; harness `internal/session/bdd_acp_session_test.go`), `session_branch_delete.feature` (a deleted branch is retracted from its parent; `external/httpserver/bdd_branch_delete_test.go`), `session_export.feature` and `session_export_cli.feature` ([Session export](session-export.md)).
- Unit tests: `internal/session/filesystem_test.go` (the bundle layout and listing), `internal/session/branches_test.go` (fork slicing and `branches.json` bookkeeping), `external/cli/continue_test.go` (`-c` resolution), and in the SPA `external/ui/src/ui/chat/BranchNavigator.test.tsx`, `branchInject.test.ts` and `resolveLatestLeaf.test.ts`.
