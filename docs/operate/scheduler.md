# Scheduler

## Overview

The scheduler is an optional cron-like runner. It scans a single job directory for flat `*.md` files (YAML frontmatter plus markdown body) and starts each job when due. A run is a **background agent task**: the same thing a `spawn_agent` call starts ([Subagents](../features/subagents.md)), a task of kind `agent` in the background task pool ([Background tasks](../features/background-tasks.md)) backed by a child session, both hanging under one session per job. That job session is the job's run history, and the runs panel of the web UI shows it the way the chat's Tasks panel shows a chat's tasks. The scheduler is compiled in only with the **`scheduler`** build tag.

Pieces:

- **`external/scheduler`** - the **`Serve`** entry **`foxxycode serve`** runs under **`scheduler.enable`**; the console and **`foxxycode acp`** start the same daemon with **`--scheduler`**.
- **`external/scheduler/daemon`** - the UTC minute tick and the **runtime**: what starts a run, stops it, knows whether a job is running, applies retention and keeps the job session.
- **`external/scheduler/storage`** - flat job discovery, YAML frontmatter, UTC cron, the **`.state`** sidecar.
- **`external/scheduler/service`** (**`schedservice`**) - shared CRUD, the run rows, HTTP and tool payloads (no cycles with **`internal/tools`**).
- **`external/scheduler/tools`** - **`schedtools`** registers **`foxxycode_scheduler_*`** tools (one `*.go` file per tool under **`tools/`**) when **`scheduler.enable`** is true.
- **`internal/agent/scheduled_run.go`** - **`RunScheduledJob`**, the run itself, on the child-run executor **`spawn_agent`** uses.

The cron parser uses **five fields** (**minute hour day month weekday**) in **UTC**. Fires are evaluated on **UTC minute boundaries** (second **0**, nanoseconds **0**), like **crond**: the daemon wakes once per UTC minute, scans **`scheduler.dir`**, and starts a job only when that minute matches the expression and the **`.state`** checkpoint is strictly before that minute. **`* * * * *`** therefore runs **at most once per UTC minute**. Step fields such as **`*/2 * * * *`** use the same minute grid as vixie cron (minutes **0,2,4,…** UTC); **`*/3 * * * *`** uses **0,3,6,…** UTC.

Changes to the **`schedule`** field in a job file are read on the next directory scan (no restart).

## Build

- Scheduler only - `go build -tags=scheduler ./cmd/foxxycode`
- HTTP and scheduler - `go build -tags=http,scheduler ./cmd/foxxycode` (add `,ui` with `http` for the embedded SPA)

## Enabling

The scheduler daemon and tools are active when **`scheduler.enable: true`** in config, or when you pass **`foxxycode acp -scheduler-enabled`** or **`foxxycode http -scheduler-enabled`**.

REST routes under **`/foxxycode/scheduler`** require **`-tags=http,scheduler`**; see **`docs/reference/http-api.md`**.

## Job directory

Jobs are **`*.md`** files **directly** under **`scheduler.dir`**. Nested subdirectories are not used for discovery.

When **`scheduler.dir`** is empty, it defaults to **`${FOXXYCODE_HOME}/scheduler`**.

One sidecar sits next to **`basename.md`**: **`basename.state`**, a small JSON record with the cron checkpoint (**`last_scheduled_utc`**) and, once the job ran, the id of its **job session** (**`session_id`**). Both fields are kept by both writers: a checkpoint write does not lose the session pointer, and the first run does not lose the checkpoint. Renaming a job through the API or the editor moves the sidecar with the file, so the run history follows the rename. A sidecar with no pointer (deleted by hand, or written by an older FoxxyCode) does not orphan a history: the daemon finds the job session in the sessions root by the job id it names, and records the pointer again.

The daemon writes the checkpoint **before the run starts**, using the **UTC minute start** that fired, so the next UTC minute tick does not re-trigger the same minute while the run is still going. Checkpoints are written **atomically** (temp file plus rename in the same directory). With no checkpoint yet (or a stale pre-1980 timestamp left by older builds), the first run follows **vixie-style** timing from wall clock and the five-field expression, not a backlog from the Unix epoch. Only **one** long-running process should enable the scheduler against a given **`scheduler.dir`**: two daemons on the same directory can double-fire.

Optional YAML frontmatter **`paused: true`** skips both cron ticks and **`POST …/run`** until resumed.

## Job file format

Frontmatter fields:

- **`description`** (string) - short human summary
- **`schedule`** (string) - five-field crontab, UTC
- **`cwd`** (string, optional) - empty means the FoxxyCode process cwd; relative paths resolve against process cwd at run time
- **`model`** (string, optional) - session model override for the run
- **`mode`** (string, optional) - **`agent`**, **`plan`**, **`docs`**, **`ask`**, or **`debug`** (default **`agent`**)
- **`paused`** (bool, optional) - when true, the job does not execute

Body - markdown used as the one-shot user instruction for that scheduler run.

The run's system prompt says it is a scheduled job started unattended (with the job id and the cron slot or "by hand"), that nobody answers questions, and that its final message is kept as the run's record; the definition's role follows when the job names one. Skills, rules and the environment block are present as in any session, and configured MCP servers are dialed for the job's cwd through the workspace trust gate, unless the job's definition admits no tool of any of them.

## Runs

Every job owns one ordinary session, the **job session**, minted on the first run and recorded in the sidecar. It never runs a turn of its own: a prompt against it is refused (**409** over HTTP, naming the job), it stays out of History and every default listing (**`GET /foxxycode/sessions?include_scheduler=true`** lists it), and it exists so the job's runs have a parent. A run is a child of that session, stored where a `spawn_agent` child is stored:

```
<sessions root>/<job session>/
  session.json                 schedulerRun: true, schedulerJobId: <job_id>
  background/<task_id>/        the run's task record and progress log
  subagents/<run session>/     the run's transcript (subagentRun, schedulerJobId, schedulerTrigger)
```

A run's task row carries **`kind: "agent"`**, the label **`<job_id> · cron 2026-09-18 10:00 UTC`** (or **`· manual …`**), and **`agent: {"name": <job_id or its definition>, "session_id": <run session>}`**. Its progress log is what the Tasks panel shows for any subagent run (`→ tool`, `✓ tool`, `[assistant]` lines, the closing `=== subagent report ===` block); its transcript is the run session, read-only, with a notice that names the job and links back to the job's runs. Statuses are the pool's: **`running`**, **`succeeded`**, **`failed`** (the turn ended with an error), **`timed_out`** (**`scheduler.timeout`** hit), **`stopped`** (cancelled), **`orphaned`** (the process died with the run in flight).

- **One run at a time per job.** The daemon reserves the job before anything starts, so a cron tick and a manual run cannot both start it; a due slot that lands while a run is in flight is skipped and logged.
- **`scheduler.max_queue`** caps how many runs are in flight across all jobs. A tick past the cap skips the job for that slot with a warning; a manual run past it answers **409**.
- **`scheduler.timeout`** is the run's hard limit; the pool caps it at **`tools.background.max_timeout_seconds`** like any task, and the daemon warns at start when the scheduler limit is above the cap.
- **Cancel** stops the run's task; the run is recorded as **`stopped`**.
- **Retention.** **`scheduler.retain_sessions`** (default **5**) keeps that many **finished** new-format runs per job, newest by start time; when a run finishes, older ones lose their task record and their transcript. **Clear** in the runs panel (**`DELETE /foxxycode/scheduler/jobs/{job_id}/runs`**) drops every finished new-format run. Deleting a job deletes its job session with every run under it. Historical **`sched_`** bundles remain readable and are not removed by these operations.
- **Nothing stays in memory between runs.** A finished run's session is retired and its pool entries released; the records come back from the bundles when the panel asks for them. Work a run leaves behind (a backgrounded `run_command`, a subagent it spawned) is stopped when the run's turn returns, as for any child.
- **Restart.** A run the process died with shows as **`orphaned`**; the checkpoint keeps its slot from firing again.

A scheduled run sits at spawn depth **0**: within **`subagents.max_depth`** it may spawn subagents of its own, which count against **`subagents.max_concurrent`** like any spawn. It is never woken by a finished task (`notify_on_finish` is off for everything it starts).

Runs of the scheduler shipped before this design (top-level **`sched_`** bundles) stay hidden from History, but **`GET /foxxycode/scheduler/jobs/{job_id}/runs`** still lists them. Their transcript remains readable through the session API. These historical rows have no task or job session id; the runs panel, which reads the job session's background tasks, shows runs created by the new scheduler.

Daemon process logging stays short (**`slog`**: **`scheduler_run_spawn`** and **`scheduler_run_finish`** with the job, the run session, the task and the status); full traces live in the run session.

## Runs in the web UI

Every job row shows its last run (the status dot and clock of the Tasks panel) and a **Runs** control that opens the job's runs: the background tasks panel of the job session, docked where the job editor docks (the editor's footer has the same control). Route: **`#/scheduler/jobs/<job_id>/runs`** and **`#/scheduler/jobs/<job_id>/runs/<task_id>`** for one run. A running run is a card with a Stop control; finished runs are one line each under the **Finished** counter; opening a run shows its progress log, and **Open transcript** opens the run session. The panel polls **`GET /foxxycode/sessions/{job session}/background-tasks`** every 2.5 s while a run is in flight and every 15 s otherwise, exactly as the chat's panel does.

## HTTP API

With **`-tags=http,scheduler`**, **`GET /foxxycode/scheduler/jobs`** (rows carry **`running`**, **`session_id`** and **`last_run`**), job CRUD, **`pause`** / **`resume`**, **`run`** (**202** with **`task_id`**, **`session_id`** and **`run_session_id`**), **`cancel`**, **`GET …/runs`** and **`DELETE …/runs`** mirror the **`schedservice`** layer; the runs panel itself polls the session's background-tasks routes. **`503`** if **`scheduler.enable`** is false. OpenAPI merges these paths only when **scheduler** is linked (see **`external/httpserver/scheduler_http.go`** vs **`scheduler_http_stub.go`**).

## Tools (when scheduler is enabled)

- **`foxxycode_scheduler_jobs_list`** - list jobs (**`include_body`** optional)
- **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_get`** - one job JSON including **`body`**
- **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_create`** / **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_replace`** / **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_patch`** (optional **`new_job_id`** renames the job file; **`agent`** and **`permission_mode`** are fields like the others)
- **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_delete`**
- **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_pause`** / **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_resume`**
- **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_run`** - manual run (does not advance cron **`.state`**); answers with the task and the run session
- **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_cancel`**
- **`foxxycode_scheduler_job_runs`** - the run rows of a job

Legacy names **`foxxycode_scheduler_list`**, **`read`**, **`write`**, **`delete`**, **`validate`** are removed.

## Example job (minute tick)

```md
---
description: "Minute tick"
schedule: "* * * * *"
cwd: ""
mode: agent
---

In the session working directory run

bash -lc 'date -u +%FT%TZ > tick.txt'
```

A job under a read-only definition, with a narrowed permission mode:

```md
---
description: "Nightly audit"
schedule: "0 3 * * *"
mode: agent
agent: reviewer
permission_mode: accept_edits
---

Review yesterday's commits and write the findings to docs/audit/<date>.md.
```
