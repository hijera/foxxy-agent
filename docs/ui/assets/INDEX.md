# UI reference images

This folder contains reference screenshots used to align the embedded UI with the target design.

## Navbar (RPA-style references, May 2026)

Implementation note: **Coddy does not render a circle or logo glyph** before the **Coddy agent** brand. Some references still show that circle, treat it as layout inspiration only.

- `ref-navbar-narrow-tooltips-accent.png` - narrow vertical rail, tooltips right, purple hover on icon
- `ref-navbar-narrow-icons-only.png` - narrow rail, icons only (Coddy uses History + GitHub + API, not News or Projects)
