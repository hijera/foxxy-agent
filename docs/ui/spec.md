# Coddy embedded UI specification

This page captures the original UI requirements and the intended end state. It is a functional spec and a design contract.

## Constraints

- UI ships as static assets embedded into the `coddy` binary (build tag `http`).
- Runtime has no auth and no API key checks for the UI.
- UI must work over the same origin as `coddy http`.
- UI copy is English.

## Layout

Desktop layout

- **Brand** is **typography only** (**Coddy** and **agent**). **No** circular logo or icon before the brand text, regardless of older reference images that include a circle.
- Desktop nav is a **vertical panel** with rounding on the **right** edge (not a full-height center-pill). On **`min-width: 1920px`**, the wide rail header includes an icon with **horizontal lines** used **only** to **collapse** to narrow rail, not as a global navigation drawer.
- Left rail opens **chat history** from **History** under the brand; brand click goes to the **start screen** (**new chat**).
- Sessions list is **always** a **drawer overlay** with backdrop at **all** breakpoints and rail widths (**no** inline column beside the rail that would shrink the chat area). The panel heading and related chrome use the copy **History**.
- Optional rail **narrow versus wide** (icons plus labels) only when **`min-width: 1920px`**, persisted in **`coddy_nav_rail`** cookie (**`narrow`** default)
- Main chat area with streamed assistant output
- Right rail is out of scope for the current milestone

Wide screens

- **`min-width: 1920px`** may enable the rail widen control and cookie-backed layout (**see DESIGN.md**). **History** remains a **floating drawer** next to the measured nav column (**`--rail-shell-track-width`**); do not fix **`left`** with a static pixel constant for wide rails.

Mobile layout

- On mobile the left rail becomes a top bar to preserve horizontal space; the top bar is **`position: fixed`** at the viewport top (**`shell-main`** is padded with **`--coddy-mobile-top-inset`**) while **`body`** scrolls the chat.
- On mobile the brand stays on a single line.

Header links

- GitHub link to `https://github.com/coddy-project/coddy-agent` (**new tab**, `rel=noopener`).
- API docs link to `/docs/` (**new tab**, `rel=noopener`).
- Links live in the nav rail for this milestone.

Narrow-rail tooltips (desktop)

- When the rail has **no** wide labels, **hover tooltips** reinforce icon meaning (example **New Chat** on the brand, **History** on history). **Wide labeled rail** hides those tooltips; labels are the affordance.
- After opening **History**, the history trigger's tooltip must **not** stay visible if the pointer still hovers the rail (see **DESIGN.md**).

## Sessions

- Session id is generated client side only after the first message is sent from a new chat.
- Session id is persisted in the URL fragment.
  - Recommended format `#/s/<sessionId>`
- Session id is sent in the `X-Coddy-Session-ID` header for chat transport.
- Session id validation matches `internal/session/ValidateFolderSessionID`.
- Session persisted files live under the session directory and are deleted together when the session is deleted.
  - `tool_calls/` tool call history
  - `stats.json` token usage totals

Session title

- UI shows the session title in the chat header.
- When the title is missing, UI shows `New chat`.
- Title is editable inline. On blur the UI saves via `PATCH /coddy/sessions/{id}`.

## Session list

- **History** panel lists sessions via `GET /coddy/sessions` (still a **drawer**, not a persistent second column).
- Pagination uses `limit` and `cursor`, with **infinite scroll** for older rows.
- Optional **`q`** query string (**title substring or first **`user`** message content substring only**, case insensitive; **not** full-chat search). Search input updates use client debouncing.
- CRUD
  - Rename via `PATCH /coddy/sessions/{id}` setting `title`.
  - Delete via `DELETE /coddy/sessions/{id}`.
  - Create new chat starts on the home screen. Session id is created only on first send.

Session rename UX

- Title rename is done only in the chat header.
- On blur the UI saves via `PATCH /coddy/sessions/{id}`.

Session delete UX

- Each row has a trash icon button.
- Clicking delete shows one confirm dialog and then calls `DELETE /coddy/sessions/{id}`.
- The sessions panel does not close on delete or on switching chats. If the user deletes the currently open chat, show the start screen under the panel until the user closes history.

## Chat transport

- Primary transport is `POST /v1/responses`.
- `stream: true` uses SSE.

Mode selection

- UI lets the user select a mode from `GET /v1/models` (at minimum `agent` and `plan`).
- Selected mode is sent as `model` field in `POST /v1/responses`.

SSE payloads

- Default SSE lines stream OpenAI like deltas.
- Named SSE events
  - `tool_call`
  - `tool_call_update`
  - `plan`
  - `token_usage`
  - Default (no `event:`): chat completion chunk deltas, including `delta.content` and optional `delta.reasoning_content`

## Composer primary action (`#btn-send`)

Shape and glyphs

- The control sits to the **right** of the context ring (**`.composer-icon`** on **`Composer.tsx`**).
- The hit target is a **perfect circle**: equal **width** and **height**, **`border-radius: 50%`**, **`box-sizing: border-box`** (currently **42×42px** in **`styles.css`**). Do **not** ship a rounded square or squircle for this control unless the visual spec explicitly changes again.
- **Play** (**idle**, draft non-empty): Unicode triangle **`▶`**, enlarged vs body text (**`~22px`** glyph via **`composer-send-glyph`**), slight horizontal nudge for optical centering.
- **Stop** (**while streaming`): Unicode **`■`**, **~17–18px** so the block fills the circle without clipping.
- **Disabled** idle state when textarea is whitespace-only (**`:disabled`** on **`composer-send-play`**).

Behavior (unchanged summary)

- **Enter** submits when idle and not generating; **`Shift+Enter`** newline. No submit while **`generating`**.
- **Stop**: **`POST /coddy/sessions/{id}/cancel`** + **`fetch`** **`AbortSignal`**. Details in **`DESIGN.md`** and **`docs/http-api.md`** (**cancelling** section).

Regression

- Automated UI checks (**Playwright MCP** or **`@playwright/test`**) MAY assert **`#btn-send`** **`offsetWidth`** **≈** **`offsetHeight`** and computed **`border-radius`** **≥ half** **`min(width,height)`** (within sub-pixel tolerance).

## Composer slash skills and mirror caret

Authoritative narrative and visual tokens live in **`DESIGN.md`** (slash picker, mirror contract, verification table). This section is the functional contract for regression.

Wire and draft

- **`textarea#composer`** holds **plain text** only. Invoked skills appear as **`/<name>`** tokens (space after picker selection). The UI **must not** persist **`[/<name>](coddy-skill:<name>)`** in the draft.
- First user turn on **`POST /v1/responses`** carries the same plain slash tokens as the composer value (no client-side markdown injection for skills in the request body).

Picker and segmentation

- Menu visibility and **`prefix`** derive from **`slashMenuDraftAtCaret`** in **`external/ui/src/ui/skills/draftSlash.ts`** (line-start or whitespace before **`/`**, optional suffix, not inside fences or blockquotes).
- Mirror highlighting uses **`segmentComposerSlashSpans`** in **`external/ui/src/ui/skills/segmentComposerSlashSpans.ts`** (mid-line **`/`** supported; **`x/foo`** is not a command token).

Mirror and caret alignment

- Non-empty drafts: textarea text is drawn **transparent**; **`.composer-mirror-inner`** shows the visible line including **`.composer-skill-chip-inline`** (**`data-testid="composer-skill-chip"`**).
- Composer chips **must not** use horizontal **padding**, **margin**, or a **border** that changes inline width. Use **`box-shadow`** for outline. **`font-family`**, **`font-size`**, **`line-height`**, **`font-weight`**, **`letter-spacing`** on chip and **`#composer`** must match so the caret lines up (**`ResizeObserver`** syncs scrollbar gutter).

Transcript vs composer

- **`user_message`** runs **`slugSlashesForUserBubbleMarkdown`** before **`Markdown`**, producing display autolinks rendered as **`span.coddy-skill-chip`** (**`data-testid="coddy-skill-span"`**). Transcript chips may use stronger typography and padding; they are **not** subject to the mirror contract.

Verification use cases

| ID | Expectation | Primary automated check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UC1 | One chip for **`asdfasf /find-skills asdfasdf`**, plain **`textarea.value`** | **`external/ui/src/ui/chat/Composer.test.tsx`** (`composer highlights plain slash token as chip while editing`) |
| UC2 | Mid-line menu open after whitespace | **`draftSlash.test.ts`** (`slashMenuDraftAtCaret works after whitespace mid-line`) |
| UC3 | **`x/foo`** no chip for **`/foo`** | **`segmentComposerSlashSpans.test.ts`** (`segmentComposerSlashSpans skips letter before slash`) |
| UC4 | Line-leading **`/foo`** chip | **`segmentComposerSlashSpans.test.ts`** (`segmentComposerSlashSpans line start slash`) |
| UC5 | **`stripCoddySkillMarkdownLinks`** on legacy paste | **`segmentComposerSlashSpans.test.ts`** (`stripCoddySkillMarkdownLinks restores plain slash token`) |
| UC6 | Bubble shows **`coddy-skill-span`** for **`hi /demo there`** | **`UserMessage.test.tsx`** |
| UC7 | Display-only **`slugSlashes`** (plain **`/`** and legacy mix) | **`segmentComposerSlashSpans.test.ts`** (`slugSlashesForUserBubbleMarkdown for Markdown chip render`, `slugSlashesForUserBubbleMarkdown strips legacy first then chips`) |
| UC8 | Live **`coddy http`**: **`fontFamily`** parity chip vs **`#composer`**, caret **`selectionStart === value.length`** at EOL after fill | **Playwright MCP** **`browser_evaluate`** after **`make build TAGS="http ui"`** |

## Transcript message types

The chat transcript renders a flat list of UI message blocks. Each block has a `type` and a minimal set of required fields.

- `user_message`
  - Plain user input text.
- `thinking`
  - Renders model reasoning as a lightweight disclosure row.
  - Status `in_progress` shows label `thinking...` and a spinner.
  - Status `completed` shows label `thinking` and preserves the text for review.
  - Multiple `thinking` blocks may appear in one turn (reasoning can resume after tool calls).
- `tool_call`
  - A single tool execution row, same disclosure chrome as **thinking** / **memory** (**chevron**, **`thinking-label`** with the tool name or kind, **`thinking-dur`** for duration or **`-`**).
  - While **`pending`** or **`in_progress`**, the summary label uses a **`...`** suffix (for example **`read_file...`**). **`startedAtMs`** drives a live duration until the tool finishes.
  - Details show arguments and streamed result when expanded. The **result** body is plain text only (rendered like **`<pre>`**, **no** Markdown pipeline), monospace, muted grey (**`.tool-result-raw`**). If **`resultPreviewTruncated`** is false / **`resultWasTruncated`** unset, no **Load more** link and no fixed-height viewport (block height follows content). If truncated (19 content lines plus **`...`**), apply the capped viewport (~20 lines), **overflow-y** hidden until **Load more**. **Load more results** (**`data-testid="tool-result-more-link"`**) performs **GET `/coddy/sessions/{id}/tool-calls/{toolCallId}`**, then **overflow-y auto** and **Hide** (**`data-testid="tool-result-hide-link"`** ); **Hide** restores the clipped preview without a second GET while **fullResultText** stays in memory.

## Tool call card (bundled SPA, current)

Authoritative behaviour matches **`DESIGN.md`** tool timeline plus this checklist.

| Concern | Current behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Component | **`ToolCallMessage.tsx`** - **`thinking-row coddy-tool-call-row`**, **`details.thinking-details.coddy-tool-details`**, **`data-testid`**: **`tool-details-{toolCallId}`** |
| Summary | Same pattern as **thinking** (**`thinking-summary`**, **`thinking-left`**, **`thinking-chevron`**, **`thinking-label`**, **`thinking-dur`**), **`aria-label="Tool summary"`** |
| Args | **`pre.tool-block`**, **`aria-label="Tool arguments"`** (inside **`thinking-body coddy-tool-call-body`**) |
| Result | **`div`** with **`tool-block tool-result tool-result-raw`**, **`aria-label="Tool result"`**, inner **`pre.tool-result-pre`** |
| Markdown | Not used for tool **result** (user or assistant bubbles still use the Markdown pipeline per below) |
| List merge | **`App.tsx`** **`loadMessages`** merges **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/tool-calls`** rows into **`resultText`**, **`resultWasTruncated`**, timing |
| Full text | First **Load more** only - **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/tool-calls/{toolCallId}`**, use JSON **`result`** (same object includes **`meta`**, **`args`**) |
| CSS | **`styles.css`**: **`.coddy-tool-call-row`**, **`.coddy-tool-call-body`**, **`thinking-details:not([open])` body hidden**, plus **`.tool-result-raw`** and viewport / toggle classes above |

- `assistant_message`
  - Final assistant output text for the turn, after tool calls.

## Live token usage

- UI must show token counters while the agent is working.
- Counters update when SSE event `token_usage` arrives.
- Update granularity is per completed backend model call, not per generated token.
- UI restores token counters after restart via `GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/stats`.

## Markdown rendering

- Tool outputs are excluded; they stay raw monospace text (**`ToolCallMessage`**).
- User and assistant messages may contain Markdown.
- UI renders Markdown with fenced code blocks and syntax highlighting.
- Each code block has a copy button that copies only that block content.

## Plan and todo list

- Right rail shows the current plan entries.
- Load via `GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/plan`.
- Save via `PUT /coddy/sessions/{id}/plan`.
- Archive via `POST /coddy/sessions/{id}/plan/archive`.

## Long term memory

Memory tree roots

- `global`
- `workspace`

Tree API

- `GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/memory/tree`
  - Without `root` returns the roots list.
  - With `root` and optional `path` lists children.
- Only `.md` and `.txt` files are listed.
- Path traversal must be rejected.

File API

- `GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/memory/file` reads.
- `PUT /coddy/sessions/{id}/memory/file` writes.

## Swagger

- Swagger UI is served under `/docs/`.
- OpenAPI spec is served under `/openapi.yaml` and `/openapi.json`.
- Swagger UI assets must be embedded, no CDN.

## Development workflow

- Edit TypeScript sources under `external/ui/src/`.
- Use `npm --prefix external/ui run dev` to iterate without rebuilding the Go binary.
- Build and sync embed assets with `npm --prefix external/ui run build:go`.
- **`make build TAGS="http ui"`** runs the UI build step (**make ui-build**) before linking the embedded bundle.

## UI test scenarios

These scenarios are intended to be automated via Playwright against the Vite dev server.

- Desktop navigation has no width toggle
  - Given viewport width is at least 1024px
  - When the app loads
  - Then `data-testid="nav-menu"` is visible
  - And `data-testid="nav-toggle-width"` is not present

- Sessions are drawer only
  - Given any desktop viewport
  - When the app loads
  - Then `data-testid="sessions"` is not visible
  - When user clicks `data-testid="nav-menu"`
  - Then `data-testid="sessions"` becomes visible
  - When user clicks `data-testid="sessions-close"`
  - Then the sessions drawer is hidden

- Mobile uses top bar and single line brand
  - Given viewport width is at most 1199px
  - When the app loads
  - Then the nav width toggle is not present
  - And the nav rail height is 78px
  - And sessions can still be opened from the menu button

- Tool calls survive restart
  - Given a session has tool calls executed
  - When the user reloads the page
  - Then tool call cards are visible in the transcript
  - And expanding a tool card shows args and raw grey **result** preview
  - And if the server marked the preview truncated, **Load more results** then **Hide** behave as in the table above; if not truncated, there is no **Load more** row and no **`tool-result-viewport--tall`** on the result panel

- Tool result truncation (Playwright MCP)
  - Given a persisted session whose tool output on disk exceeds the preview line cap
  - When the user opens the tool card and clicks **Load more results**
  - Then the link becomes **Hide**, full lines are available inside the same max-height scrollable panel, and **`.tool-result-viewport--scroll`** has **`scrollHeight`** greater than **`clientHeight`**
  - When the user clicks **Hide**
  - Then the preview shows the capped text ending in **`...`**, **`overflow-y`** is hidden on **`.tool-result-viewport--clip`**, and **Load more results** appears again

- Token usage survives restart
  - Given a session has non zero token usage
  - When the user reloads the page
  - Then the token usage HUD shows the persisted totals

- Memory copilot row (Playwright MCP)
  - Given **`memory.enabled: true`** on the **`coddy http`** process and at least one Markdown file under global or workspace memory so recall can run
  - When the user sends a chat message that completes a full ReAct turn
  - Then an element with **`data-testid="memory-copilot-row"`** appears after that user bubble for the turn (grey **memory** foldout, same visual language as **thinking** per `DESIGN.md`)
  - When the user opens the details element
  - Then the streamed **memory** body shows the text merged into the main agent prompt for that turn (and optional saved-note preview when the copilot wrote `coddy_memory_save`)

For Playwright MCP against a live gateway, start **`make build TAGS="http ui"`** then **`./build/coddy http`** with a disposable **`--home`** so config can enable memory; open **`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`**, navigate to a session, send a prompt, assert the snapshot contains **memory-copilot-row** and folded body text after expand.
