# Coddy embedded UI specification

This page captures the original UI requirements and the intended end state. It is a functional spec and a design contract.

## Constraints

- UI ships as static assets embedded into the `coddy` binary (build tag `http`).
- Runtime has no auth and no API key checks for the UI.
- UI must work over the same origin as `coddy http`.
- UI copy is English.
- Favicon matches [coddy.dev](https://coddy.dev/) (**`/coddy-favicon.svg`**, same mark as **`docs/assets/coddy-logo-mark-flat.svg`**, plus PNG/ICO fallbacks embedded with the SPA).

## Appearance (light / dark theme)

- **Default:** dark theme on first visit.
- **Cookie:** **`coddy_ui_theme`** with values **`dark`** or **`light`** (path **`/`**, **`SameSite=Lax`**).
- **Toggle:** **Settings** (**`#/settings`**) → **Appearance** → **Dark** / **Light** (**`data-testid="theme-toggle-dark"`**, **`theme-toggle-light`**).
- **Settings sub-panels (Appearance / Skills) are mutually exclusive** — opening one closes the other. Only one sub-panel may be expanded at a time.
- **Persistence:** switching theme writes the cookie and sets **`document.documentElement.dataset.theme`**; reload must keep the chosen theme.
- **CSS contract:** **`--text`** and **`--bg`** on **`[data-theme="light"]`** are **`#18181b`** and **`#f8f8fa`**; glass panels use **`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)`** (not dark tint). Dark defaults remain on **`:root`** / **`[data-theme="dark"]`**.

## Layout

Desktop layout

- **Brand** is **typography only** (**Coddy** and **agent**). **No** circular logo or icon before the brand text, regardless of older reference images that include a circle.
- Desktop nav is a **vertical panel** with rounding on the **right** edge (not a full-height center-pill). On **`min-width: 1920px`**, the wide rail header includes an icon with **horizontal lines** used **only** to **collapse** to narrow rail, not as a global navigation drawer.
- Left rail opens **chat history** from **History** under the brand; brand click goes to the **start screen** (**new chat**).
- **Brand**, **History**, **Scheduler** (when linked), **Settings**, and each row in the **History** list use real fragment **`href`** values (**`#/`**, **`#/history`**, **`#/scheduler`**, **`#/scheduler/new`** (new job editor), **`#/settings`**, **`#/s/<sessionId>`**) so **middle-click** or **Ctrl/Cmd-click** opens a **new browser tab** on the same origin while another tab can keep streaming.
- Sessions list is **always** a **drawer overlay** with backdrop at **all** breakpoints and rail widths (**no** inline column beside the rail that would shrink the chat area). The panel heading and related chrome use the copy **History**.
- Optional rail **narrow versus wide** (icons plus labels) only when **`min-width: 1920px`**, persisted in **`coddy_nav_rail`** cookie (**`narrow`** default)
- Main chat area with streamed assistant output
- Right rail is out of scope for the current milestone

Wide screens

- **`min-width: 1920px`** may enable the rail widen control and cookie-backed layout (**see DESIGN.md**). **History** remains a **floating drawer** next to the measured nav column (**`--rail-shell-track-width`**); do not fix **`left`** with a static pixel constant for wide rails.

Mobile layout

- On mobile the left rail becomes a top bar to preserve horizontal space; the top bar is **`position: fixed`** at the viewport top (**`shell-main`** is padded with **`--coddy-mobile-top-inset`**) while **`body`** scrolls the chat.
- On mobile the brand stays on a single line.

Header links

- GitHub link to `https://github.com/coddy-project/coddy-agent` (**new tab**, `rel=noopener`).
- API docs link to `/docs/` (**new tab**, `rel=noopener`).
- Links live in the nav rail for this milestone.

Narrow-rail tooltips (desktop)

- When the rail has **no** wide labels, **hover tooltips** reinforce icon meaning (example **New Chat** on the brand, **History** on history). **Wide labeled rail** hides those tooltips; labels are the affordance.
- After opening **History**, the history trigger's tooltip must **not** stay visible if the pointer still hovers the rail (see **DESIGN.md**).

## Sessions

- Session id is generated client side only after the first message is sent from a new chat.
- Session id is persisted in the URL fragment.
  - Recommended format `#/s/<sessionId>`
- Unsent composer text may be kept as a client-only draft session.
  - Draft sessions use `#/draft/<draftId>` and are stored in `localStorage` under `coddy_draft_sessions_v1`.
  - History rows show a `Draft:` title prefix.
- Session id is sent in the `X-Coddy-Session-ID` header for chat transport.
- Session id validation matches `internal/session/ValidateFolderSessionID`.
- Session persisted files live under the session directory and are deleted together when the session is deleted.
  - `tool_calls/` tool call history
  - `stats.json` token usage totals

### Parallel sessions and generation cancel

- Several sessions may **stream at once**, each with its own **`POST /v1/responses`** and **`X-Coddy-Session-ID`**. The app keeps a **per-session shadow** transcript so rapid hash switches do not mis-route SSE updates; see **`pickStreamMutationBase`** in **`external/ui/src/ui/chat/streamMutationBase.ts`**.
- **Stop** uses **`POST /coddy/sessions/{id}/cancel`** and **`AbortSignal`** on the streaming **`fetch`**. The server persists **partial** assistant **`content`** for that turn when tokens had already arrived. **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/messages`** may return an older snapshot briefly; the UI **merges** with local shadow or visible rows when the response is only a prefix (**`mergeTranscriptPreferLocalSuffix`**, **`keepLocalTranscriptIfServerEmpty`** in **`external/ui/src/ui/chat/transcriptServerSnapshot.ts`**). The transcript is cleared on fetch failure **only** when the failed load targets the **currently viewed** session so Stop does not wipe the chat.

Session title

- UI shows the session title in the chat header.
- When the title is missing, UI shows `New chat`.
- Title is editable inline. On blur the UI saves via `PATCH /coddy/sessions/{id}`.

### Per-session model

- **New chat** defaults **Model** from cookie **`coddy_llm_model`**, then **`default_agent_model`** from **`GET /v1/models`**, then the first YAML row.
- **Opening a session** restores **Model** from **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/messages`** field **`model`** (session override on disk), not from the cookie.
- Changing **Model** writes the cookie (default for the next **New chat**) and **`PATCH`** **`selectedModelId`** on the active session. ReAct turns still send **`metadata.model`** on **`POST /v1/responses`**.

## Session list

- **History** panel lists sessions via `GET /coddy/sessions` (still a **drawer**, not a persistent second column).
- Pagination uses `limit` and `cursor`, with **infinite scroll** for older rows.
- Optional **`q`** query string (**title substring or first **`user`** message content substring only**, case insensitive; **not** full-chat search). Search input updates use client debouncing.
- Indicators
  - A spinner appears on rows for sessions that are still generating in the background.
  - A violet dot appears only when a background session completed while it was not the active chat.
  - A question mark icon appears when a session is waiting for user permission.
- CRUD
  - Rename via `PATCH /coddy/sessions/{id}` setting `title`.
  - Delete via `DELETE /coddy/sessions/{id}`.
  - Create new chat starts on the home screen. Session id is created only on first send.

Session rename UX

- Title rename is done only in the chat header.
- On blur the UI saves via `PATCH /coddy/sessions/{id}`.

Session delete UX

- Each row has a trash icon button.
- Clicking delete shows one confirm dialog and then calls `DELETE /coddy/sessions/{id}`.
- If the deleted session is **not** the one currently shown in the main chat, remove it from the list (and refresh from the server) and **keep the History drawer open**. Do not change the URL or clear the transcript for the session that stayed on screen.
- If the deleted session **is** the one currently shown, navigate to **new chat** (empty start screen, session hash cleared), **close** the History drawer, and clear composer-related state as for a normal home transition.
- For a short interval after the user confirms delete, **ignore** shell **backdrop** pointer-driven close so a stray event from the native confirm does not dismiss History or alter the route.

## Chat transport

- Primary transport is `POST /v1/responses`.
- `stream: true` uses SSE.

Mode selection

- UI lets the user select a mode from `GET /v1/models` (at minimum `agent` and `plan`).
- Selected mode is sent as `model` field in `POST /v1/responses`.

SSE payloads

- Default SSE lines stream OpenAI like deltas.
- Named SSE events
  - `tool_call`
  - `tool_call_update`
  - `plan`
  - `token_usage`
  - Default (no `event:`): chat completion chunk deltas, including `delta.content` and optional `delta.reasoning_content`

## Composer primary action (`#btn-send`)

Context ring and breakdown popover

- **Hover** on **`.composer-context-tip-host`**: compact tooltip (percent, input/output/total, max context) unchanged.
- **Click** opens **`ContextBreakdownPopover`** beside the ring on wide viewports (**`context-breakdown-menu--portal`**); on stacked shell (**`max-width: 1199px`**) it uses the same bottom sheet + scrim as slash / **`@`** pickers (**`context-breakdown-menu--sheet`**, **`slash-sheet-backdrop`**). **Escape** or **Close** dismisses; hover tooltip returns when closed.
- Legend keys map to **`contextBreakdown`** on **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/stats`** (`systemPrompt`, `toolDefinitions`, `rules`, `skills`, `mcp`, `conversation`). Vitest: **`Composer.test.tsx`** (`click context ring opens breakdown popover`).

Shape and glyphs

- The control sits to the **right** of the context ring (**`.composer-icon`** on **`Composer.tsx`**).
- The hit target is a **perfect circle**: equal **width** and **height**, **`border-radius: 50%`**, **`box-sizing: border-box`** (currently **42×42px** in **`styles.css`**). Do **not** ship a rounded square or squircle for this control unless the visual spec explicitly changes again.
- **Play** (**idle**, draft non-empty): Unicode triangle **`▶`**, enlarged vs body text (**`~22px`** glyph via **`composer-send-glyph`**), slight horizontal nudge for optical centering.
- **Stop** (**while streaming**): filled square **`.composer-stop-square`** (**14x14px**, centered in the **42px** circle). Stays in **`composer-bar-actions`** on the right, next to the context ring.
- **Disabled** idle state when textarea is whitespace-only (**`:disabled`** on **`composer-send-play`**).

Behavior (unchanged summary)

- **Enter** submits when idle and not generating; **`Shift+Enter`** newline. No submit while **`generating`**.
- **Stop**: **`POST /coddy/sessions/{id}/cancel`** + **`fetch`** **`AbortSignal`**. The server may append a **partial** assistant message for that turn. **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/messages`** can lag; the bundled UI merges server rows with local shadow or on-screen items (**`transcriptServerSnapshot.ts`**). Details in **`DESIGN.md`** (**Multi-session streaming and Stop**) and **`docs/http-api.md`**.

Regression

- Automated UI checks (**Playwright MCP** or **`@playwright/test`**) MAY assert **`#btn-send`** **`offsetWidth`** **≈** **`offsetHeight`** and computed **`border-radius`** **≥ half** **`min(width,height)`** (within sub-pixel tolerance).

## Composer file attachments (multimodal)

- The paperclip button (**`data-testid="composer-file-input"`** hidden `<input type="file">` triggered by a visible icon button) appears in the composer **only** when the active model has **`multimodal: true`** from **`GET /v1/models`**. The flag is derived from **`models[].multimodal`** in YAML config and propagated through **`ModelInfo.multimodal`** → **`llmModelMultimodal`** in **`App.tsx`** → **`Composer`** prop.
- Attached files are held in **`attachedFiles: File[]`** state on **`Composer`**. Preview chips appear above the composer input showing file name and type icon.
- On send, **`App.tsx`** reads each file as a data URL via **`FileReader`** and includes **`inline_files: [{name, data_url}]`** in the **`POST /v1/responses`** body.
- **Agent / plan turns**: the server writes each file to **`~/.coddy/sessions/<id>/assets/`** (permissions **`0o444`**) and injects a **`<coddy_session_assets>`** XML block into the user message so the agent can **`read`** or **`cp`** those paths. Duplicate asset names get **`_1`**, **`_2`** suffixes (see `internal/session/assets.go` **`SavePartsToAssets`**).
- **Direct YAML model turns**: each file becomes an **`image_url`** content part sent inline to the provider.
- The user bubble strips the XML annotation via **`stripCoddyAttachmentsForUserDisplay`** in **`stripCoddyAttachments.ts`** and shows file chips (**`msg-user-files`** / **`msg-user-file-chip`** CSS classes). **`parseSessionAssetFiles`** re-derives chip metadata on page reload.
- After a **`PUT /coddy/config`** save in Settings, **`App.tsx`** bumps **`modelsEpoch`** → re-fetches **`/v1/models`** so the attachment button appears or disappears without a page reload.

| Case | Expected | Automated check |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| FA1 | Paperclip visible only when `llmModelMultimodal` is true | `Composer.test.tsx` |
| FA2 | File chips render in user bubble after send | `stripCoddyAttachments.test.ts` |
| FA3 | Chips persist on reload via `parseSessionAssetFiles` | `stripCoddyAttachments.test.ts` |

## Composer slash skills and mirror caret

Authoritative narrative and visual tokens live in **`DESIGN.md`** (slash picker, mirror contract, verification table). This section is the functional contract for regression.

Wire and draft

- **`textarea#composer`** holds **plain text** only. Invoked skills appear as **`/<name>`** tokens (space after picker selection). The UI **must not** persist **`[/<name>](coddy-skill:<name>)`** in the draft.
- First user turn on **`POST /v1/responses`** carries the same plain slash tokens as the composer value (no client-side markdown injection for skills in the request body).

Picker and segmentation

- Menu visibility and **`prefix`** derive from **`slashMenuDraftAtCaret`** in **`external/ui/src/ui/skills/draftSlash.ts`** (line-start or whitespace before **`/`**, optional suffix, not inside fences or blockquotes).
- Mirror highlighting uses **`segmentComposerSlashSpans`** in **`external/ui/src/ui/skills/segmentComposerSlashSpans.ts`** (mid-line **`/`** supported; **`x/foo`** is not a command token).

Mirror and caret alignment

- Non-empty drafts: textarea text is drawn **transparent**; **`.composer-mirror-inner`** shows the visible line including **`.composer-skill-chip-inline`** (**`data-testid="composer-skill-chip"`**).
- Composer chips **must not** use horizontal **padding**, **margin**, or a **border** that changes inline width. Use **`box-shadow`** for outline. **`font-family`**, **`font-size`**, **`line-height`**, **`font-weight`**, **`letter-spacing`** on chip and **`#composer`** must match so the caret lines up (**`ResizeObserver`** syncs scrollbar gutter).

Transcript vs composer

- **`user_message`** bubbles render **plain text** only (**`msg-user-body`**, **`white-space: pre-wrap`**). No Markdown pipeline, no transcript skill chips (**`coddy-skill-span`**). Slash tokens such as **`/path/to`** and YAML blocks stay exactly as persisted, with line breaks preserved.
- Composer mirror chips (**`composer-skill-chip`**) apply **only** while editing **`#composer`**, not in the transcript.
- Persisted user turns may carry hydrated attachments as **`coddy_attachment`** XML with **`path`**, **`name`**, and CDATA file bodies (**`internal/agent`**). **`stripCoddyAttachmentsForUserDisplay`** replaces each XML block with a compact **`@path`** **only when** that path is **not** already present as an **`@`** mention in the surrounding text (**avoids duplication** because the persisted turn already repeats the **`@`** in the user text plus the hydrated block).

Verification use cases

| ID | Expectation | Primary automated check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UC1 | One chip for **`asdfasf /find-skills asdfasdf`**, plain **`textarea.value`** | **`external/ui/src/ui/chat/Composer.test.tsx`** (`composer highlights plain slash token as chip while editing`) |
| UC2 | Mid-line menu open after whitespace | **`draftSlash.test.ts`** (`slashMenuDraftAtCaret works after whitespace mid-line`) |
| UC3 | **`x/foo`** no chip for **`/foo`** | **`segmentComposerSlashSpans.test.ts`** (`segmentComposerSlashSpans skips letter before slash`) |
| UC4 | Line-leading **`/foo`** chip | **`segmentComposerSlashSpans.test.ts`** (`segmentComposerSlashSpans line start slash`) |
| UC5 | **`stripCoddySkillMarkdownLinks`** on legacy paste | **`segmentComposerSlashSpans.test.ts`** (`stripCoddySkillMarkdownLinks restores plain slash token`) |
| UC6 | User bubble keeps **`hi /demo there`** plain (no **`coddy-skill-span`**) | **`UserMessage.test.tsx`** |
| UC7 | Multiline YAML / paths keep **`\\n`** layout in **`user-message-body`** | **`UserMessage.test.tsx`** |
| UC7b | Display-only **`slugSlashes`** (plain **`/`** and legacy mix) | **`segmentComposerSlashSpans.test.ts`** (`slugSlashesForUserBubbleMarkdown …`; composer / legacy only, not transcript) |
| UC8 | Live **`coddy http`**: **`fontFamily`** parity chip vs **`#composer`**, caret **`selectionStart === value.length`** at EOL after fill | **Playwright MCP** **`browser_evaluate`** after **`make build TAGS="http ui"`** |
| UC9 | User bubble hides **`coddy_attachment`** bodies, shows **`@path`** only | **`UserMessage.test.tsx`**, **`stripCoddyAttachments.test.ts`** |

## Composer **`@`** workspace files

- **`textarea#composer`** keeps plain **`input`** including literal **`@path`** text. **`POST /v1/responses`** adds **`attachments`** (**`path`** only) parsed by **`extractAtFileAttachments`** in **`external/ui/src/ui/skills/draftAt.ts`** for **`agent`** / **`plan`** only. Server-side **`HydratePromptContentBlocks`** uses **`ExtractAtFilePathsFromText`** (**`internal/session/at_paths_extract.go`**) after filling empty **`resource`** bodies so **`@path`** literals inside **`type: text`** blocks become extra **`resource`** rows when that path is not already hydrated (**matches HTTP **`attachments`** without duplicating**).
- **`@`** menu uses **`GET /coddy/workspace/files`** with **`dirs=true`** so **`kind`** **`dir`** rows drill down. Choosing a **`dir`** inserts **`@`** + **`path_rel`** (often ending in **`/`**) without hydrating file body. Choosing a **`file`** inserts **`@`** + **`path_rel`** plus a trailing ASCII space where appropriate. **`Composer`** defers two **`updatePickerMenus`** ticks after a row choice so the workspace dropdown does not immediately reopen (trailing space and **`MENU_PATH_CHAR`** still satisfy **`atMenuDraftAtCaret`** until the user edits again).
- Empty **`@`** prefix (caret right after **`@`**) loads recent rows from **`localStorage`** (**`workspaceAtRecents`**), keyed by **`sessionId`** (or **`__no_session__`** before the first assigned id), with no extra banner line (**`Type after @ to search`** only when the list is empty). Entries come from **`@`** row picks and **`extractAtFileAttachments`** on successful profile sends (**`migrateWorkspaceAtRecents`** merges when the client generates or the server rotates **`X-Coddy-Session-ID`**).
- Fenced code blocks and Markdown blockquote lines suppress **`@`** menu parity with **`draftSlash`** ( **`inMarkdownFenceBeforeCaret`**, **`blockquoteLine`** ).
- Mirror **`@`** styling uses **`segmentComposerMirrorSpans`** (**`composer-at-chip-inline`**, **`data-testid="composer-at-chip"`**). **`listAtPathSpans`** (**`draftAt.ts`**) chips every completed **`@path`** atom even when prose follows (**`draftAt`** parity with **`extractAtFileAttachments`**), while text after the caret that is still inside **`MENU_PATH`** stays on the active token until the **`atMenuDraftAtCaret`** lexer breaks out.
- **`@`** search with zero matches keeps the picker open (**`No files`**) instead of collapsing the menu (**`composer-at-chip-inline`** hides for **`atNoMatch`**, same **`atIdx`**, **`prefix`** as the stale filter).
- Stacked-shell viewports (**`(max-width: 1199px)`**) render workspace and slash pickers as a **`slash-menu--sheet`** with **`slash-sheet-backdrop`** so the panel is usable on phones.
- Picker subtitle uses **`workspacePickRowSubtitle`** - second column shows **`parent/`** only when **`path_rel`** is nested, root entries omit it (empty string).

| Case | Expected | Automated check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AT1 | Spaces inside paths ( **`readme copy.md`** ) work in picker draft and hydrate when attached | **`draftAt.test.ts`**, **`session/promptfiles_test.go`** (**`hello world.txt`**) |
| AT2 | **Prefix** substring filter (**case-insensitive**), empty **prefix** returns empty **`items`** on server | **`TestCoddyWorkspaceFilesGetPagingAndPrefixes`** |
| AT3 | Prose **`see @note.txt`** does not merge **`and`** into the path segment | **`draftAt.test.ts`** (**`extractAtFileAttachments`** connector words) |
| AT4 | **`@`** inside **`session/prompt`** text alone still hydrates (no duplicate when **`attachments`** or **`resource`** already has body text) | **`TestHydratePromptContentBlocksExpandsAtInText`**, **`at_paths_extract_test.go`** |
| AT5 | Picker second column shows **`parent/`** for nested **`path_rel`**, empty at workspace root (**`workspacePickRowSubtitle`**) | **`workspacePickRowSubtitle.test.ts`** |

## Transcript message types

The chat transcript renders a flat list of UI message blocks. Each block has a `type` and a minimal set of required fields.

- `user_message`
  - Plain user input text (**no Markdown**; **`pre-wrap`** preserves line breaks).
- `thinking`
  - Renders model reasoning as a lightweight disclosure row.
  - Status `in_progress` shows label `thinking...` and a spinner.
  - Status `completed` shows label `thinking` and preserves the text for review.
  - Multiple `thinking` blocks may appear in one turn (reasoning can resume after tool calls).
- `tool_call`
  - A single tool execution row, same disclosure chrome as **thinking** / **memory** (**chevron**, **`thinking-label`** with the tool name or kind, **`thinking-dur`** for duration or **`-`**).
  - While **`pending`** or **`in_progress`**, the summary label uses a **`...`** suffix (for example **`read_file...`**). **`startedAtMs`** drives a live duration until the tool finishes.
  - Details show arguments and streamed result when expanded. The **result** body is plain text only (rendered like **`<pre>`**, **no** Markdown pipeline), monospace, muted grey (**`.tool-result-raw`**). If **`resultPreviewTruncated`** is false / **`resultWasTruncated`** unset, no **Load more** link and no fixed-height viewport (block height follows content). If truncated (19 content lines plus **`...`**), apply the capped viewport (~20 lines), **overflow-y** hidden until **Load more**. **Load more results** (**`data-testid="tool-result-more-link"`**) performs **GET `/coddy/sessions/{id}/tool-calls/{toolCallId}`**, then **overflow-y auto** and **Hide** (**`data-testid="tool-result-hide-link"`** ); **Hide** restores the clipped preview without a second GET while **fullResultText** stays in memory.

## Tool call card (bundled SPA, current)

Authoritative behaviour matches **`DESIGN.md`** tool timeline plus this checklist.

| Concern | Current behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Component | **`ToolCallMessage.tsx`** - **`thinking-row coddy-tool-call-row`**, **`details.thinking-details.coddy-tool-details`**, **`data-testid`**: **`tool-details-{toolCallId}`** |
| Summary | Same pattern as **thinking** (**`thinking-summary`**, **`thinking-left`**, **`thinking-chevron`**, **`thinking-label`**, **`thinking-dur`**), **`aria-label="Tool summary"`** |
| Args | **`pre.tool-block`**, **`aria-label="Tool arguments"`** (inside **`thinking-body coddy-tool-call-body`**) |
| Result | **`div`** with **`tool-block tool-result tool-result-raw`**, **`aria-label="Tool result"`**, inner **`pre.tool-result-pre`** |
| Markdown | Not used for tool **result** or **user** bubbles; **assistant** still uses Markdown per below |
| List merge | **`App.tsx`** **`loadMessages`** merges **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/tool-calls`** rows into **`resultText`**, **`resultWasTruncated`**, timing |
| Full text | First **Load more** only - **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/tool-calls/{toolCallId}`**, use JSON **`result`** (same object includes **`meta`**, **`args`**) |
| CSS | **`styles.css`**: **`.coddy-tool-call-row`**, **`.coddy-tool-call-body`**, **`thinking-details:not([open])` body hidden**, plus **`.tool-result-raw`** and viewport / toggle classes above |

- `assistant_message`
  - Final assistant output text for the turn, after tool calls.

## Live token usage

- UI must show token counters while the agent is working.
- Counters update when SSE event `token_usage` arrives.
- Update granularity is per completed backend model call, not per generated token.
- UI restores token counters after restart via `GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/stats`.

## Markdown rendering

- Tool outputs are excluded; they stay raw monospace text (**`ToolCallMessage`**).
- **User** messages are plain text with preserved line breaks (**`UserMessage`**).
- **Assistant** messages may contain Markdown.
- UI renders Markdown with fenced code blocks and syntax highlighting.
- Each code block has a copy button that copies only that block content.

## Markdown line editor (shared)

Implemented as **`MarkdownLineEditor`** (`external/ui/src/ui/markdown/MarkdownLineEditor.tsx`). Used for:

- Scheduler job **`body (markdown)`** (`SchedulerJobEditorSheet`, default **`minRows`** **10**).
- Plan document card markdown mode (`PlanDocumentSection`, **`minRows`** **4**, class **`md-line-editor--plan`**).

Behaviour (see **`DESIGN.md`**, **Markdown line editor**):

- Full parent width; editor height follows content (minimum logical rows); **no** scrollbar on the inner **`textarea`**.
- Gutter shows one number per **logical** line (`\n`-separated). Wrapped visual lines leave **blank** gutter cells (no duplicate numbers).
- Caret logical line: highlight spans **all** visual rows of that line; active gutter number tinted.
- Wrap measurement uses a hidden probe with the same font and text width as the textarea; visual rows = **`ceil(height / lineHeight)`**.
- Long unbreakable tokens wrap (**`overflow-wrap: anywhere`**); no horizontal scroll inside the editor.

Automated checks:

- `external/ui/src/ui/markdown/MarkdownLineEditor.test.tsx`
- `external/ui/src/ui/markdown/markdownLineGutter.test.ts`

## Plan document card (plan mode transcript)

Transcript type **`plan_document`** renders **`PlanDocumentSection`** in the main chat column (not a right rail).

Data and API:

- Persisted in **`messages.json`**; hydrated fields include **`slug`**, **`name`**, **`overview`**, **`content`**, optional **`body`**, **`path`**, **`discarded`**.
- Body edit: **`PUT /coddy/sessions/{id}/plans/{slug}`** with **`{ "body": "<markdown>" }`** (debounced autosave).
- Discard: **`DELETE /coddy/sessions/{id}/plans/{slug}`** sets **`discarded: true`**; card remains visible, controls disabled.
- Run plan: client triggers implementation run (metadata / prompt; see **`docs/acp-protocol.md`**).

UI requirements:

- Collapsed: title, one-line description, **Discard** and **Run plan** in footer; title **`title`** tooltip = absolute plan file path when known.
- Expanded: **Preview** default (rendered markdown via **`Markdown`**); eye toggle switches to **`MarkdownLineEditor`**.
- Content pane grows with document length for **both** preview and markdown (**no** inner max-height scroll on the pane).
- Expanded desktop (**`min-width: 640px`**): title row and action buttons share the top row; body full width below.
- Editor body excludes YAML frontmatter (client **`planEditorBody`**); preview uses the same body text.

Automated checks:

- `external/ui/src/ui/chat/PlanDocumentSection.test.tsx`

## Plan and todo list (legacy rail)

- Optional right-rail plan entries (if present in a build) use **`GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/plan`**, **`PUT`**, **`POST .../plan/archive`**.
- Distinct from the **`plan_document`** transcript card above.

- `global`
- `workspace`

Tree API

- `GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/memory/tree`
  - Without `root` returns the roots list.
  - With `root` and optional `path` lists children.
- Only `.md` and `.txt` files are listed.
- Path traversal must be rejected.

File API

- `GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/memory/file` reads.
- `PUT /coddy/sessions/{id}/memory/file` writes.

## Swagger

- Swagger UI is served under `/docs/`.
- OpenAPI spec is served under `/openapi.yaml` and `/openapi.json`.
- Swagger UI assets must be embedded, no CDN.

## Development workflow

- Edit TypeScript sources under `external/ui/src/`.
- Use `npm --prefix external/ui run dev` to iterate without rebuilding the Go binary.
- Build and sync embed assets with `npm --prefix external/ui run build:go`.
- **`make build TAGS="http ui"`** runs the UI build step (**make ui-build**) before linking the embedded bundle.

## UI test scenarios

These scenarios are intended to be automated via Playwright against the Vite dev server.

- Desktop navigation has no width toggle
  - Given viewport width is at least 1024px
  - When the app loads
  - Then `data-testid="nav-menu"` is visible
  - And `data-testid="nav-toggle-width"` is not present

- Sessions are drawer only
  - Given any desktop viewport
  - When the app loads
  - Then `data-testid="sessions"` is not visible
  - When user clicks `data-testid="nav-menu"`
  - Then `data-testid="sessions"` becomes visible
  - When user clicks `data-testid="sessions-close"`
  - Then the sessions drawer is hidden

- Mobile uses top bar and single line brand
  - Given viewport width is at most 1199px
  - When the app loads
  - Then the nav width toggle is not present
  - And the nav rail height is 78px
  - And sessions can still be opened from the menu button

- Tool calls survive restart
  - Given a session has tool calls executed
  - When the user reloads the page
  - Then tool call cards are visible in the transcript
  - And expanding a tool card shows args and raw grey **result** preview
  - And if the server marked the preview truncated, **Load more results** then **Hide** behave as in the table above; if not truncated, there is no **Load more** row and no **`tool-result-viewport--tall`** on the result panel

- Tool result truncation (Playwright MCP)
  - Given a persisted session whose tool output on disk exceeds the preview line cap
  - When the user opens the tool card and clicks **Load more results**
  - Then the link becomes **Hide**, full lines are available inside the same max-height scrollable panel, and **`.tool-result-viewport--scroll`** has **`scrollHeight`** greater than **`clientHeight`**
  - When the user clicks **Hide**
  - Then the preview shows the capped text ending in **`...`**, **`overflow-y`** is hidden on **`.tool-result-viewport--clip`**, and **Load more results** appears again

- Token usage survives restart
  - Given a session has non zero token usage
  - When the user reloads the page
  - Then the token usage HUD shows the persisted totals

- Memory copilot row (Playwright MCP)
  - Given **`memory.enabled: true`** on the **`coddy http`** process and at least one Markdown file under global or workspace memory so recall can run
  - When the user sends a chat message that completes a full ReAct turn
  - Then an element with **`data-testid="memory-copilot-row"`** appears after that user bubble for the turn (grey **memory** foldout, same visual language as **thinking** per `DESIGN.md`)
  - When the user opens the details element
  - Then the streamed **memory** body shows the text merged into the main agent prompt for that turn (and optional saved-note preview when the copilot wrote `coddy_memory_save`)

For Playwright MCP against a live gateway, start **`make build TAGS="http ui"`** then **`./build/coddy http`** with a disposable **`--home`** so config can enable memory; open **`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`**, navigate to a session, send a prompt, assert the snapshot contains **memory-copilot-row** and folded body text after expand.
