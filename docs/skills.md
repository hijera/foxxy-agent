# Skills

Skills are reusable instruction packs that extend the agent with slash commands, domain knowledge, and specialized workflows. They power the **`{{.Skills}}`** block in the system prompt and the slash-command catalog surfaced to ACP clients and the HTTP UI.

> **Project rules** (`.coddy/rules`, `.cursor/rules`, etc.) are a separate mechanism injected as **`{{.Rules}}`**. Do not place rules in `skills.dirs`. See [rules.md](rules.md).

## Where to get skills

### skills.sh — community registry

The open agent skills ecosystem lives at **[https://skills.sh](https://skills.sh)**. Skills are plain GitHub repos with a `SKILL.md` file, compatible across agents that support the format (Cursor, Claude Code, Coddy, etc.).

Install via **`npx skills`** (Node.js required):

```bash
# Search the registry
npx skills find [query]

# Install a skill globally into ~/.agents/skills/
npx skills add <owner/repo@skill>

# Update all installed skills
npx skills update

# Check for updates
npx skills check
```

Global skills land in **`~/.agents/skills/`** — shared with any agent that reads that directory.

### skillsbd — Coddy-curated registry

**[https://neuraldeep.ru/skills](https://neuraldeep.ru/skills)** is the **skillsbd** registry, curated for Coddy specifically. Install its CLI:

```bash
npm install -g skillsbd
```

Key commands:

```bash
# Search the registry
npx skillsbd search [query]

# Install a skill
npx skillsbd install <name>

# List installed skills
npx skillsbd list
```

Skills from skillsbd are also installed into **`~/.agents/skills/`** by default, so Coddy picks them up automatically via the default `skills.dirs`.

You can also browse and install through the Coddy web UI: **Settings → Skills → Registry**.

## Directory layout

Coddy searches all directories in `skills.dirs` and deduplicates by skill name. **Later directories have higher priority** — if the same skill name appears in multiple directories, the version from the directory listed last wins.

Default directories (lowest → highest priority):

| Priority | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| lowest | `~/.agents/skills/` | Global skills installed by `npx skills` / `npx skillsbd` — shared with all agents |
| ↑ | `~/.coddy/skills/` | Coddy-specific skills; may contain symlinks into `~/.agents/skills/` |
| highest | `${CWD}/.coddy/skills/` | Project-local skills — override anything from global/user directories |

Override in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
skills:
  dirs:
    - "~/.agents/skills"
    - "${CODDY_HOME}/skills"
    - "${CWD}/.coddy/skills"
    - "~/my-team-skills"
```

`${CODDY_HOME}` and `${CWD}` expand at runtime (per-session cwd for `${CWD}`).

---

## Supported file formats

### `subdir/SKILL.md` (recommended)

One skill per directory. Compatible with the Cursor skills layout and `npx skills`:

```
~/.agents/skills/
  code-review/
    SKILL.md
  docker-helper/
    SKILL.md
```

### Root `.md` / `.mdc` in a skill directory

Flat files at the root of a `skills.dirs` entry also register as skills (stem becomes the slash name).

### YAML frontmatter

Each skill file must have a frontmatter block with exactly two fields — both required and non-empty:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: One-line summary shown in the slash-command catalog and UI.
---

# Code Review

Full skill body here...
```

`name` sets the canonical slash-command identifier (e.g. `/code-review`). It overrides the filesystem-derived name when set. `description` is shown in the catalog and the Settings → Skills panel.

---

## Enable / disable without uninstalling

```bash
coddy skills list              # show all skills with enabled/disabled status
coddy skills disable <name>    # skip a skill without removing it
coddy skills enable <name>     # re-enable
```

Disabled state is stored in `~/.coddy/skills/.disabled` (plain text, one name per line).

---

## Writing your own skill

Create a directory anywhere and add `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Short description shown in the catalog.
---

# My skill

Instructions the agent will follow when this skill is active.
```

Then add the parent directory to `skills.dirs` in `config.yaml`, or drop the directory into `~/.coddy/skills/` or `${CWD}/.coddy/skills/`.

To share it with others, publish to GitHub and list it on [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) or submit to [neuraldeep.ru/skills](https://neuraldeep.ru/skills).

## How skills are applied

On each `session/prompt` the agent:

1. Scans `skills.dirs` for the session cwd and `CODDY_HOME`.
2. All loaded (and enabled) skills are always active — their bodies are available as slash commands and injected on demand.
3. Builds the **`{{.Skills}}`** system-prompt block: the slash-command catalog listing all skills, plus the full body of any always-active or glob-matched skill whose name is **not** already in the catalog.
4. At LLM call time, if the last user message contains `/name` invocations, each matched skill's body is **prepended to the user message** before it is sent to the model. This augmentation happens only inside the LLM request — it is **not stored in session history** and is **not visible in the chat transcript**.

ACP clients receive `available_commands_update` after `session/new` and `session/load`. The HTTP UI queries `GET /coddy/slash-commands` for autocomplete.
