# ReAct Agent: Design Specification

## Role in FoxxyCode

FoxxyCode is modeled as **harness plus execution engine**. This document specifies that engine -

- the **ReAct loop** in `internal/agent` that turns prompts and tools into streamed turns,
- default **coding-agent** behavior - tool registry, `agent`, `plan`, `docs`, `ask`, and `debug` modes, permission gates.

The same harness may use a narrower tool surface or different clients (automation, not only IDEs).

The ReAct flow and message contract below stay stable for any ACP-speaking session.

## What is ReAct?

ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) is an agent paradigm where the LLM alternates between:
- **Thought** - internal reasoning about what to do next
- **Action** - calling a tool or producing output
- **Observation** - receiving the result of the action

Reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629

## ReAct Loop Implementation

### System Prompt Structure

Built-in templates are assembled from manifests and Go **`text/template`** fragments under **`internal/prompts/sections/<mode>/`** for **agent**, **plan**, **docs**, **ask**, and **debug**. Variant fragments resolve by configured model-reference slug, provider-neutral API-model slug, and family. A configured **`prompts.dir`** keeps the legacy complete-file overrides (**`agent.md`**, **`plan.md`**, **`docs.md`**, and **`ask.md`**, plus dotted variants).

Rendered order matches the markdown files roughly as follows:

```
[Intro + Mode + How to work / How to plan]
Working directory: {{.CWD}}

{{if .Tools}}
## Available tools
{{.Tools}}
{{end}}

{{if .Skills}} ... skill catalog + always-active/glob-matched bodies
          (invoked /name bodies are injected into the user message instead) ... {{end}}

{{if .TodoList}}
### Current todo checklist
{{.TodoList}}
{{end}}

{{if .Memory}}
## Session memory
{{.Memory}}
{{end}}

## Current UTC time
{{.UTCNow}}

<environment_context>
<os>...</os>
<arch>...</arch>
<shell>...</shell>
</environment_context>
```

The **`TodoList`** body is markdown from **`internal/tools/todo.FormatPlanMarkdown`** applied to **`session.Plan`**. It is injected **only when** at least one entry exists. Embedded templates treat an empty **`TodoList`** as false for **`{{if .TodoList}}`**. The environment block is appended outside the configurable template so OS and shell facts cannot be accidentally omitted by a custom prompt. Editor project metadata is appended the same way: readable files under the workspace's **`.idea`** and **`.vscode`** directories become **`<intellij_idea_project_context>`** and **`<vscode_project_context>`** blocks (**`internal/session/editor_project_context.go`**), capped per file and in total, and framed as data rather than as instructions.

Immediately before **each** provider **`Stream`** call within a single **`session/prompt`**, FoxxyCode reapplies **`Render`** so the **`system`** message reflects todo changes from tools executed earlier in that same episode. **`UTCNow`** is set to **`time.Now().UTC()`** formatted as RFC3339 on each render so the footer clock advances across ReAct iterations.

### Agent identity

**Every system prompt FoxxyCode sends opens by naming the product.** The sentence lives in **`internal/prompts/identity.go`** as **`prompts.Identity`** (**`"You are FoxxyCode, an AI coding agent."`**), and **`prompts.WithIdentity`** is what puts it there.

Why it exists: an LLM gateway cannot tell one OpenAI-compatible client from another by the wire protocol, so gateways attribute traffic by matching the **opening of the system prompt** against a table of known products (**`"You are Claude Code…"`**, **`"You are Cline…"`**). FoxxyCode used to open with a generic sentence and was therefore invisible in that kind of analytics. Treat **`prompts.Identity`** as a published contract: gateways key on the **`you are foxxycode`** substring, and rewording it silently drops FoxxyCode out of their reports until they catch up.

Where it is applied:

- **`buildSystemPrompt`** (`internal/agent/system_prompt.go`), around the language directive and the rendered template — covers every mode, a user's own **`prompts.dir`** template, and the render fallback;
- both compaction engines (`internal/agent/compact.go`, `internal/agent/compaction.go`) — a summarizer is its own request with its own system prompt;
- the auxiliary prompts: session titles (`internal/agent/title.go`), chat-title descriptions (`external/httpserver/foxxycode_foxxycode.go`), prompt enhancement (`external/httpserver/enhance_prompt.go`) and the memory copilot (`external/memory/copilot.go`).

Two properties the tests lock (`internal/prompts/identity_test.go`, `internal/agent/identity_prompt_test.go`):

1. the marker lands within the **first 220 characters**, because that is the prefix a gateway inspects — a long **`{{.CWD}}`** must not push it out;
2. the line appears **exactly once**. This fork keeps the built-in templates generic and opens every prompt with the **`## Response language`** directive, which is long enough to push a template's own opening past the 220-character window — so **`WithIdentity`** wraps the directive plus the template and contributes the only identity sentence there is. Branding the templates too would print the line twice.

A custom **`prompts.dir`** template does **not** need to name FoxxyCode: the line is prepended for it automatically.

### Tool Calling via Function Calling API

Modern LLMs support native function/tool calling. The agent uses this instead of
text-based ReAct prompting:

1. Tools are defined as JSON Schema objects and passed to the LLM API
2. LLM returns structured tool call requests (not raw text)
3. Agent executes the requested tools
4. Results are appended to conversation as `tool` role messages
5. LLM continues reasoning with tool results in context

This approach is more reliable than text parsing and supported by all major providers
(OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama with compatible models).

### Conversation Message Structure

```
messages: [
  { role: "system",    content: <system_prompt> },
  { role: "user",      content: <user_prompt> },
  { role: "assistant", content: "", tool_calls: [{ id: "call_1", name: "read_file", args: {...} }] },
  { role: "tool",      tool_call_id: "call_1", content: <file_contents> },
  { role: "assistant", content: "", tool_calls: [{ id: "call_2", name: "write_file", args: {...} }] },
  { role: "tool",      tool_call_id: "call_2", content: "OK" },
  { role: "assistant", content: <final_answer> }
]
```

### Loop Steps

```
1. BUILD_MESSAGES
   - Load applicable skills and project rules for current context (separate prompt sections)
   - Build system prompt (template + TemplateData incl. TodoList snapshot)
   - For the last user message, detect `/name` invocations: prepend each matched skill's body to the message content before the LLM call. This augmentation is ephemeral — not persisted to session history, not shown in the chat transcript.
   - Prepend system to session history (user turn already persisted on Run entry)

2. LLM_CALL
   - Send messages + tool definitions to LLM provider
   - Receive response: may contain text + tool_calls

3. STREAM_RESPONSE
   - For each text chunk: send session/update(agent_message_chunk)
   - For each tool_call: send session/update(tool_call, status=pending)

4. EXECUTE_TOOLS (if any tool calls)
   - For each tool_call sequentially inside one assistant message:
     a. Send session/update(tool_call_update, status=in_progress)
     b. If requires permission: session/request_permission -> wait for response
     c. Execute tool (built-in or MCP)
     d. Send session/update(tool_call_update, status=completed|failed, content=result)
     e. Append tool result to conversation history

5. REFRESH_SYSTEM
   - Next loop iteration repeats from step 2 after rewriting messages[0] with a fresh **`Render`** (same session state, potentially new Plan rows)

6. CHECK_COMPLETION
   - If no tool calls in last response -> DONE (stopReason: end_turn)
   - If turn_count >= max_turns -> DONE (stopReason: max_turns)
   - Otherwise -> back to step 2

   Loop guard (**`agent.loop_guard`**, default on) can end the turn earlier:
   - A streamed response repeating the same passage **`loop_stream_repeat_cycles`** times
     in a row (answer text or reasoning) has its stream cancelled. The repeated run is
     stripped from the stored message, so it is never replayed to the model.
   - A tool call repeated **`loop_tool_repeat_limit`** times with identical canonical
     arguments is not executed; the model gets a result explaining why.
   - A whole *sequence* of calls repeated **`loop_tool_cycle_repeats`** times is not
     executed either. This is what catches a model rotating through several calls
     (read A, read B, read A, ...), which resets the consecutive counter above and
     would otherwise run to max_turns. A lap that varies slightly still counts, and
     arguments are part of the comparison, so working through a different file each
     round is progress rather than a cycle.
   - Any of these first nudges the model to change course, up to **`loop_nudge_max`**
     times. After that, **`agent.loop_stuck_action`** decides:
     - **`quarantine`** (default): the looping calls are taken away for the rest of the
       turn - each one answered with an explanation instead of being executed - and the
       turn continues with every other tool still available. `read` and `grep` run one
       last time first and their results are pinned against eviction, because their loop
       exists precisely because that content kept disappearing. If two rounds in a row
       consist only of blocked calls, the next request is sent with **no tool
       definitions** and the model answers from what it has -> DONE (stopReason: end_turn).
     - **`stop`**: -> DONE (stopReason: agent_refused) with a notice.
   - A degenerate output stream always ends the turn, in either mode: there is
     nothing to quarantine when the output itself is the problem.

7. FINAL_RESPONSE
   - Send session/prompt response with stopReason
```

   - Send session/prompt response with stopReason
```

## Endings that must never be silent

Two endings reach the caller as an ordinary success, so neither is visible unless the
turn says something:

- **The output cap.** A model that reaches **`models[].max_tokens`** stops mid-sentence
  while the stream still closes cleanly (**`finish_reason: length`** followed by
  **`[DONE]`**). The turn ends with **`stopReason: max_tokens`** - which no UI surface
  renders - so it appends a notice to the transcript naming the cap, the tokens spent and
  the setting to raise (**`maxTokensNotice`**, `internal/agent/max_tokens_notice.go`).
  Unlike a stall there is nothing to wait out: the model did not fail, it ran out of the
  budget the configuration gave it. This matters most on reasoning models - hidden
  thinking is billed against the same budget as the visible answer, so the text can run
  out well before the number suggests. Measured on `kimi-k2.6` at `max_tokens: 8192`,
  roughly half the budget went to reasoning the user never saw.
- **A stream abandoned mid-answer.** Bounded by **`agent.llm_stall_timeout_ms`** and the
  **`agent.llm_stall_retry`** family, which keep the partial answer and ask the model to
  carry on rather than ending the turn. See `docs/config-reference.md` for the keys.
- **A lane, not a model, that failed.** One model name at a proxy is usually a group of
  interchangeable deployments, and a sick member fails per attempt rather than per
  conversation. Two failures are therefore answered by re-issuing the identical request
  before anything else is tried:
  - A streamed call the first-token guard cut with **nothing produced** is replayed
    immediately (**`maxFirstTokenReissues`**), ahead of the waiting ladder and on the same
    **`agent.llm_stall_retry`** switch. That iteration is repeated, not counted against
    **`max_turns`** - a call that produced nothing is not a reasoning step the model chose.
    It is safe by construction: no chunk reached the client and no message was appended.
    Only if the replay is silent too does the ladder start pausing, which is the recovery
    a saturated gateway needs.
  - A turn that ends with neither answer text nor a tool call is replayed once as well
    (**`maxEmptyAssistantReissues`**), counted like the wording nudge it precedes, with
    the empty assistant turn dropped from the
    LLM-facing message slice so the outgoing request is byte for byte the one that failed.
    The transcript keeps that turn, because the user watched its reasoning stream in. The
    wording nudge (**`maxEmptyAssistantContinuations`**) follows only if the replay came
    back empty too.
  - Both budgets reset as soon as the model makes progress.

  Every error a provider returns is prefixed with the **`providers[].name`** it came from
  and the address that request actually reached (`internal/llm/provider_label.go`), because
  the address is not always the one the operator has in mind - **`type: openai`** with no
  **`api_base`** talks to **`https://api.openai.com/v1`**. The label sits **outside** the
  resilient wrapper, so retry classification still reads the untouched upstream error, and
  it wraps rather than replaces the cause, so **`errors.Is`** and **`errors.As`** keep
  working.

### Tracing the stream

**`FOXXYCODE_LLM_TRACE`** writes frame-level traces of the OpenAI-compatible SSE path:
**`1`** (or **`stderr`**) to standard error, any other value as a file path. Each streamed
call logs its request shape, then a line per *decisive* frame - one carrying a
`finish_reason`, starting a tool call, or preceded by a gap over a second - and a terminal
line whose **`verdict`** names how the stream ended:

| verdict | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `complete` | terminal marker and a finish_reason both arrived |
| `truncated-by-max-tokens` | the output cap was reached |
| `cut-before-terminal-marker` | closed with neither `[DONE]` nor a finish_reason |
| `finish-reason-without-done` | finish_reason but no `[DONE]` (still a complete response) |
| `done-without-finish-reason` | `[DONE]` but no finish_reason |
| `error` | transport failure or a server error frame |
| `request-failed` | the call never produced a response |

The terminal line also reports the content/reasoning character split, the tool-call frame
count and the largest inter-frame gap - the numbers that separate "the model is writing a
long tool call" from "the connection is open and dead". Argument frames are deliberately
*not* logged individually: one real turn produced 1105 frame lines out of 1143 before that
rule, burying everything that mattered.

## Mode-Specific Behavior

### Agent Mode

Embedded **`agent.md`** describes agent behavior (quality, shells, todos). Todo-related instructions reference **`foxxycode_todo_plan_*`** and **`foxxycode_todo_item_*`** tools surfaced in **`Tools`**.

Representative builtins (excluding MCP-namespaced tools):

- `read_file`, `write_file`, `write_text_file`, `list_dir`, `search_files`
- `search_web`, `extract_page_content`
- `run_command`, `apply_diff`
- Filesystem mutations: **`mkdir`**, **`rm`**, **`rmdir`**, **`touch`**, **`mv`** (subset may require permission paths)
- Session checklist: **`foxxycode_todo_plan_read`**, **`foxxycode_todo_plan_replace`**, **`foxxycode_todo_plan_archive`**, **`foxxycode_todo_item_add`**, **`foxxycode_todo_item_remove`**, **`foxxycode_todo_item_update`**, **`foxxycode_todo_item_move`**
- All MCP server tools (names **`serverName__toolName`**)

### Plan Mode

Embedded **`plan.md`** keeps the default **registry** surface read-oriented (no built-in writes or **foxxycode** todo tools in the advertised set). **`run_command`** and all **MCP** tools from configured servers are still available for inspection.

Representative builtins exposed to the LLM (registry allowlist):

- `read_file`, `list_dir`, `search_files`
- `search_web`, `extract_page_content`
- `run_command`

Plus MCP tools (**`serverName__toolName`**). When ready to ship implementation work, prompts instruct switching the client to **`agent`** mode.

### Docs Mode

Embedded **`docs.md`** distinguishes review-only requests from explicit documentation edits and treats implemented behavior plus observable tests as the primary evidence. Built-in mutators are restricted to **`docs_write`** and **`docs_edit`**, which accept only `.md` paths under the session CWD, reject symlink escapes, and protect **`internal/prompts/`**. **`docs_write`** requires an explicit overwrite flag for an existing file, while **`docs_edit`** requires a non-empty exact match that is unique unless **`replaceAll`** is set.

Representative builtins exposed to the LLM (registry allowlist):

- `read`, `glob`, `grep`
- `websearch`, `webfetch`
- `question`
- `docs_write`, `docs_edit`

Docs mode does not expose **`run_command`** or MCP tools because those surfaces cannot currently guarantee read-only execution. Prompts instruct the user to switch to **`agent`** mode for code or configuration changes.

### Ask Mode

The embedded ask sections (**`internal/prompts/sections/ask/`**, override file **`prompts.ask_prompt`**) describe a read-only assistant: it answers from the repository and the web and never mutates anything. The registry allowlist (**`internal/agent.ToolSetForMode("ask")`**) is **`read`**, **`keep_result`**, **`glob`**, **`grep`**, **`print_tree`**, **`websearch`**, **`webfetch`**, **`question`** and **`load_skill`**; there is no shell, no plan, todo or config tool, no **`spawn_agent`**, and **MCP** tools are never appended. Unlike plan mode the allowlist is also enforced at execution time, so a call replayed from history is refused with a read-only notice. A plan mention or **`runPlanSlug`** metadata never starts a plan run in ask mode, and the memory copilot runs recall-only. Ask and docs turns never spawn subagents; agent, plan and debug turns may (**`docs/subagents.md`**).

## Built-in Tools Specification

### `read_file`
```json
{
  "name": "read_file",

    "end_line": { "type": "integer", "description": "Last line to read (1-based, optional)" }
  },
  "required": ["path"]
}
```

### `write_file`
```json
{

    "diff": { "type": "string", "description": "Unified diff content" }
  },
  "required": ["path", "diff"]
}
```

## Plan Update Format

Clients receive `session/update` notifications whose **`sessionUpdate`** field equals **`plan`**, carrying structured **`entries`**. Todolist tooling also persists the active checklist under **`todos/active.md`** in the bundle when session persistence is on (mirrors **`FormatPlanMarkdown`** / **`ParsePlanMarkdown`**).

Example payload:

```json
{
  "sessionUpdate": "plan",
  "entries": [
    { "content": "Read current auth module", "priority": "high", "status": "pending" },
    { "content": "Analyze JWT requirements", "priority": "high", "status": "pending" },
    { "content": "Write new auth implementation", "priority": "medium", "status": "pending" },
    { "content": "Update tests", "priority": "low", "status": "pending" }
  ]
}
```

Plan entries are updated as the agent progresses:
```json
{ "content": "Read current auth module", "priority": "high", "status": "completed" }
```

## Error Handling in ReAct Loop

- LLM API error: retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff, then fail turn
- Tool execution error: return error as observation, let LLM decide next step
- Permission denied: return "permission denied" observation
- Tool timeout: return "timeout" observation after configured timeout
- Context too long: summarize older messages, continue with summary
- Cancelled: abort all operations, return `cancelled` stop reason
