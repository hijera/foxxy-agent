"""Swarm e2e: a ring of three relays, two agents, and one that only dials out.

Self-contained. It boots real processes - three ``foxxycode serve`` relays and two
``foxxycode serve`` agents - wires them into the topology below, and then acts as the
client would.

    client -> outer --+-> middle --+-> agent8   (reachable, dialled by middle)
                      |            \\-> relay3
                      \\-> relay3 --+---> agent7 (dials out, no inbound port)
                                    \\---> outer  (the edge that closes the ring)

``relay3`` is reachable two ways *and* knows its way back to ``outer``, so this
is a real cycle rather than a diamond: a walk that did not keep track of where
it had been would go round it forever.

What it proves, in order:

1. an agent registers itself and appears in its relay's node list;
2. a client drives a node through a relay's mount;
3. a client drives an agent two relays away by writing the path out;
4. an agent with no advertised address is driven over the connection it opened;
5. sessions from every node arrive in one list, labelled by owner;
6. the same session id on two agents stays two sessions;
7. search reaches the work and the machine;
8. the ring is reported once, with the short route chosen and the long one kept;
9. the control plane is refused through a mount;
10. a node that goes away becomes a warning rather than an error.

Requires ``build/foxxycode`` built with ``-tags "http swarm"``. No LLM is needed:
sessions are seeded on disk, and every checked route is metadata-only.

Environment:

- ``FOXXYCODE_BIN`` - path to the binary (default ``<repo>/build/foxxycode``).
- ``SWARM_PORT_BASE`` - first of five loopback ports (default 19940).
