"""Startup: the console draws its chrome in a real pty, takes keys and exits.

No model is contacted. The script proves the terminal path on the host it
runs on - raw mode, the first frame, the keyboard, the resume hint printed
after the terminal is restored - which is what the macOS and Linux CI jobs
check with the real binary (the Go suite drives the app over a fake
terminal and never opens a pty).
