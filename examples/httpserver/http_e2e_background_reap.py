"""End-to-end check that a fresh foxxycode cleans up after one that was killed.

Self-contained: this harness boots its own ``build/foxxycode http`` instances, so it
does not depend on the server ``test_httpserver.sh`` starts.

The story it drives is the one the hard timeout cannot cover. A foxxycode that is
drained stops its background tasks; a foxxycode that is *killed* leaves the shell
trees it spawned running with nobody supervising them. The task record persists
the process group leader pid, so a fresh foxxycode over the same session bundle can
find those survivors and reap them.

  1. boot foxxycode, ask the model to start one long background task;
  2. read the task's pid from the REST surface and confirm the OS agrees;
  3. kill foxxycode outright - no drain, no cleanup;
  4. confirm the background process outlived it;
  5. boot foxxycode again on the same home and session, and ask the model to clean up;
  6. confirm the process is gone and the record says so.

Step 6 is what regressed on Windows: probing a pid there answers "can I open a
process object with this number", which is true for a corpse whose handle is
still held and true for any recycled pid, so the model was told about leftovers
that were not there and reaping ran taskkill on whatever now owned the number.

Requires ``build/foxxycode`` built with ``-tags http``.

Environment:

- ``FOXXYCODE_BIN`` - path to the foxxycode binary (default ``<repo>/build/foxxycode``).
- ``MODEL`` - YAML ``models[].model`` id (default ``neuraldeep/gpt-oss-120b``).
- ``NEURALDEEP_API_KEY`` - provider key, read by foxxycode itself. Never written to
  the generated config: a provider named ``neuraldeep`` with no ``api_key``
  falls back to this variable.
- ``REAP_PORT`` - loopback port (default 19912).

Exits non-zero on any HTTP error or unmet expectation.
